Subject: stranger ? ? ? hi there stranger ! well i haven ' t spoken to you or heard from you in a few days and i ' m just checkin ' to see that my lil ' buddy in portland isn ' t working himself too hard . as you know i tried to call you tonight but then had to leave for a workout and a scrimmage soccer game . i am so sore ! it ' s out of control ! ok so down to the real reason i ' m writing . brendan and i had a great time at happy hour . we talked a little about you but mostly about life in general . he had mentioned that he had e - mailed me so i rushed home to check it . basically he said all good things but there was one thing that struck me as odd . i guess because he also brought the same point up at the restraunt . he had written that although you thought i was cool and whatever you had commented on how " strange " the situation was and he sort of elaborated on that . so the point of this e - mail is i guess to reassure you that i only have the best intentions towards you . i am not trying to be your girlfriend or anything similar to that . to tell you the truth i don ' t even know what your " romantic " situation is . i just think you are an awesome guy whom i ' d love to become close friends with . i am ecstatic that you are coming to visit me in huntington beach ( if you still are ) and i ' m thrilled that we can go sight seeing touring together . i bragged and bragged to brendan about what a great guy you were and then came home to feel like maybe you were taken back by my advances . i really am just a very overly affectionate and loving person ( not to mention spontaneous ) . i didn ' t mean to scare you away from having a great friendship with me and me with you . for heavens sake you are my portland connection and i ' m your beach bum buddy . honestly if i were a psycho i would have jumped at the chance to come up and see your condo when you offered . i just think you are someone i ' d love to get to know . especially if you are anything like brendan ( which best friends usually are ) he is such a sweetie ! when he and meg go to visit her mom in la they might just stop over for a visit and of course they are welcome to stay with me as well . i guess i never asked if you had a girlfriend or someone in your life and to be quite honest i didn ' t even think to ask brendan because it ' s not important . i want you , bill , for your friendship and for your companionship now and when i move to portland . reflecting back i realize that i may have written or said something that caught you off guard . it ' s just my personality . i ' m a huge flirt . for heavens sake i was voted " most flirtatious " my senior year not to mention " most likely to succeed " . probably the second one due to the first but who knows ! hahaha ! i ' m only teasing . ok seriously now bill , i want you to be honest . if i did ( locating your condo etc . ) or said ( like that was the most romantic thing i had ever read that was written by a guy ) something to upset you or give you a false impression i am so sorry . i do find you attractive and perhaps if we lived in the same town or had met a little differently or for that matter i knew your " romantic " stiuation , yeah i would have jumped at the chance to have dated you . but we didn ' t and the truth is i can never have too many friends . especially good looking ones that i can introduce to all my " girl " friends so that they can be jealous with envy ! : ) like i said i only have the best of intentions towards you and towrds our relationship as friends . but if you are uncomfortable with something i ' ve done or said i am so very sorry and all you have to do is tell me or e - mail me and you ' ll never hear from me again . scouts honor ! i ' ve never been a scout but i ' m not know for my lies either . teehee . i would love to hear any concerns that you might have in regards to our realtionship as friends . if i can i ' ll put your mind at ease if not well i enjoyed our short 30 minute interlude . as always you are still welcome to come visit me and stay with me i would love to have the company . if i don ' t hear form you within the next couple of weeks i ' ll assume the worst but still try to keep my schedule as flexible as possible in case you change your mind . i ' m lucky in the fact that i can do that sort of thing ! : ) ok just e - mail me or call me . let me know that you are alive and kickin ' . i ' ll be leaving for calgary , canada this thursday morning at 6 am and will be there until the 16 th . i ' m so excited this is my first trip out of country but then again you know that ! so i guess i ' ll hear from you when i hear from you . i just thought of a last possible reason . . . i may be way off base here but i am not sure if you know the situation between my boyfriend and myself . he is a real sweetheart and he ' s going to make a wonderful husband and father . . . just not with me . if you are concerned about our friendship and him becoming weird well the majority of my friends are guys and todd is secure enough in himself that he doesn ' t care . if this is about august and you staying with me , my father is moving me down not him and it will be a long time until he can come to visit . also when i get there we are not going to continue a long distance exclusive relationship . i haven ' t dated or had much of a wild stage and i have told him that we will see other people . he ' s fine with that as well . ok i admit that his potland stunt was a little irrational but hey i thought it was thoughtful and darling . i love surprises and little " extras " . i just didn ' t expect to have made plans and make myself look like the bad guy to someone whom i ' d never met . therefore i did everything in my power to rectify the situation and make both sides happy and in doing so caused this . you think i ' m a psycho ! not to mention i had to face brendan and before he could read my e - mail you had already revealed the stroy to him ! ! so i got to be embarrssed and a little humbled by the whole experience ! ok that ' s it . take it however you will but it ' s 12 : 51 am and i ' m exhausted ! i did the best i could to figure out and fix a possibly non - existing problem . i hope i did well enough to inspire a response from you . : ) hope to hear or read from you soon ! goodnight and god bless , nikki send a cool gift with your e - card http : / / www . bluemountain . com / giftcenter /

Subject: re : pg & e texoma volumes daren and lauri : we do have a problem with some of our mirrored meters . when mips receives an " incomplete " from the parent meter it sends a - 0 - to pops . yes , this is a big problem . our pops team ( romeo d ' souza ) has identified this problem and notified mips . however , he was told this was not a priority item . in the mean time we are overriding the volumes in pops with the estimated volumes . this particular meter was correct last night , the 14 th rolled last night from mips and overrode the bav with a - 0 - from day 14 forward . this was corrected this morning and the meter re - allocated . thanks , charlotte lauri a allen 03 / 21 / 2000 09 : 04 am to : robert e lloyd / hou / ect @ ect , tom acton / corp / enron @ enron , charlotte hawkins / hou / ect @ ect cc : daren j farmer / hou / ect @ ect , pat clynes / corp / enron @ enron , bryan hull / hou / ect @ ect , gary a hanks / hou / ect @ ect subject : pg & e texoma volumes in reviewing some of the imbalance numbers , i discovered that valero texoma ( # 71 ) bav volumes have not fed into pops since 3 / 14 causing an out of balance at the meter in excess of 500 , 000 mm month to date . the more critical part of this problem , however , is that pops has fed 0 volumes back to sitara on some of the hplc deals . this means that these purchase volumes ( expenses ) have not been picked up in tom ' s p & l and are , instead , sitting in ua 4 . to the extent that the purchase prices vary from the ua 4 value , the p & l may take a hit when these actual volumes flow through . i realize that kim is out and that you guys are stretched thin , however , a problem of this magnitude needs to be addressed as soon as it ' s discovered . someone needs to be overriding the 0 volumes so that sitara is receiving correct information and the p & l is kept as accurate as possible . please give me a call if you have any questions .

Subject: discount rates and risk capital dear vince : i spent a little bit longer putting together my initial thoughts on determining discount rates than i originally anticipated . it is somewhat surprising , but there really isn ' t much academic work that i am aware of that addresses these issues . very briefly , 1 . i think we need to come up with a way to define the concept of risk capital simultaneously with the appropriate discount rate . 2 . i think it is important to model enron ' s opportunity cost of capital and how that changes over time . the liquidity of a project will affect its value in a very significant way when the opportunity cost of capital changes over time . there is also likely to be a relation between duration and discount rates that depends on the factors generating enron ' s opportunity cost of capital . 3 . i have vague ideas about possible simulations that may help us quantify some of the issues that i have raised . please take a look at the attached document . you might find this somewhat confusing , so i will give you a call later in the week to discuss this . please let me know when you will be free . i look forward to hearing from you . regards , sheridan - determining discount rates for risky projects . doc sheridan titman department of finance college of business administration university of texas austin , texas 78712 - 1179 512 - 232 - 2787 ( phone ) 512 - 471 - 5073 ( fax ) titman @ mail . utexas . edu

Subject: re : short - sell vs exercise chonawee , as i have pointed out , short - selling the stock may be a bad decision because of tax implications ( ignoring the legal aspects ) . suppose the strike is $ 70 and you were granted an atm option . you sell short at $ 70 ten lots ( one lot = 100 shares ) . the price goes to $ 100 . you lose $ 30 x 1000 = $ 30 , 000 on your short position . option exercise gives you $ 30 , 000 . this is before taxes . you pay taxes on your option income ( it ' s treated as ordinary income ) . the tax is 28 % x $ 30 , 000 = $ 8 , 400 . you can use only $ 3 , 000 of your loss against ordinary income . this saves you only $ 840 in taxes . of course , if you have capital gains , you can use losses on your option position as an offset . the remaining part of your capital loss is carried forward and you get the tax benefits over time ( less the time value of money ) , assuming you have income in the future ( or capital gains ) . not so good . by the way , valuation and optimal exercise of employee stock options is a very interesting and difficult problem . vince chonawee supatgiat @ enron 07 / 10 / 2000 11 : 40 am to : stinson gibner / hou / ect @ ect , vince j kaminski / hou / ect @ ect cc : subject : short - sell vs exercise below is my writing that was originally planned to post somewhere . it explains how to handle a special type of call options which can be exercised but cannot be sold . ( as we know that it is never optimal to exercise a call option before its maturity ) . however , after taking vince ' s comments on the ordinary income / capital loss tax offsetting issue , i think this is not a good article anymore . i guess i could just throw this article away . : - ) - chonawee short - selling is better than exercising your employee stock options in general , the sensible time to exercise your employee stock option is when you speculate that ene is going down or its growth rate is extremely low . in fact , when exercising the options , you are speculating that ene would never reach this point ( plus interest ) again during the 10 years maturity date or until you leave the company . if you do not anticipate that , you should hold on to your options because you can gain higher profit by delaying your exercise . however , if you believe that ene is reaching its peak . then , instead of exercising the options , you should short - sell ( or sell ) the stocks in that amount . after short - selling , when you feel that the stock starts to go up , you can buy them back ( to cover ) , make profit , and still keep the options . on the other hand , if the stock does not go down as expect , you can exercise the options to cover your short position anytime . let us take a look at a simple case where there are no taxes , no dividends , and zero risk - free rate . suppose that ene follows a simple sample path as follow if you exercise 100 ene options with a grant price of 45 when ene reaches 70 , you would earn ( 70 - 45 ) * 100 = $ 2 , 500 . but if you short sell 100 ene at 70 , no matter how much ene is in the future , you can exercise the options to cover the short position and still earn ( 70 - 45 ) * 100 = $ 2 , 500 . the advantage of short - selling comes when ene at the period 2 is 60 . at this point , you can cover your short position , get ( 70 - 60 ) * 100 = $ 1 , 000 , and still keep your options or you can exercise the options and gain $ 2 , 500 . that is , you still keep the flexibility of your options when you short - sell . in conclusion , the only sensible time to exercise your employee stock options is to cover your short position .

" irrespective of urgency of this approval to us , the best thing is that we are getting the approval without draft electricity bill , 2001 being finalised . as most of you are aware , initially the proposal was stalled at fipb level pending finalisation of electricity bill . then it has gone to group of ministers who had taken a positive approach and now the cabinet has cleared it . now fipb either issue an approval to enron llc or advise us to avail automatic route . we will have one of it , culminating great team work . seethayya

Subject: re : sale of napoleonville land louise , on monday , prior to my leaving for buffalo , i spoke with dave gorte and was informed that since the sale of the napoleonville land was greater than $ 2 . 5 mm , it is categorized as a diversiture requiring a dash . since the negotiations were quite contentious between reliant , texas brine and enron - we ( eva , lisa and myself ) had worked with mr . gorte to create multiple versions of the dash . it was not until wednesday afternoon that reliant was the chosen " victor . " in addition , since i felt you were apprised of the deal and mr . gorte had not informed me of an appropriate process , lisa had waited until we knew who the counterparty was before getting on your schedule . unfortunately , this meant wednesday afternoon around 4 pm , but we had been informed by tammi schoppe that you were available until 5 pm . even though the banks were closed , i had wanted to sign the executables on wednesday so reliant would not have an opportunity to change their mind over the holiday weekend . it was certainly not our intent to have you not appropriately briefed regarding the transaction . i will be flying back to houston today and will be landing around 5 pm . both eva rainer and lisa druzbik are in today and i am leaving instructions to ( hopefully ) close the deal today . julie gomez will be signing on my behalf - - for detailed questions regarding the negotiations please refer to eva . my cell is 713 - 302 - 4187 . regards , jean - - - - - original message - - - - - from : kitchen , louise sent : sun 11 / 25 / 2001 2 : 10 pm to : mrha , jean cc : lavorato , john ; gomez , julie a . ; rainer , eva ; nemec , gerald subject : re : sale of napoleonville land at 4 pm on wednesday liza arrived with the dash . it had not been circulated prior to that and there was no - one available to discuss the deal as eva was not in the office . please have someone ready to discuss this deal and circulate the dash in advance of when you want it signing . 4 pm on wednesday with no briefing on the deal didn ' t give enough time to complete a dash . louise - - - - - original message - - - - - from : mrha , jean sent : monday , november 19 , 2001 6 : 06 pm to : kitchen , louise cc : lavorato , john ; gomez , julie a . ; rainer , eva ; nemec , gerald subject : sale of napoleonville land louise , tomorrow , i am flying to buffalo , ny for thanksgiving with my father . as such , for the potential sale of the napoleonville land , julie gomez will sign on my behalf for lrci inc . after both appropriate commercial , accounting and legal parameters have been met . the status is as follows : texas brine has been informed that another counterparty has presented a premium bid of $ 3 mm and has the opportunity to counter . texas brine was the first counterparty to try to acquire the land at $ 2 . 35 mm . reliant has slowed the transaction close due to their legal changes to the " act of sale " document . as such , gerald nemec ( my legal ) is reviewing the document in conjuction with our louisiana counsel as well as other relevant internal legal groups ( i . e . litigation and environmental ) . i am confident that the land will get sold and was hoping to close the transaction prior to my leaving . however , this bidding " war " has the potential for ena to extract an even higher auction price . the approximate book value of the land is $ 1 . 4 mm . i can be reached via blackberry or cell ( 713 - 302 - 4187 ) . eva rainer , manager , is also an appropriate person to contact for any questions . regards , mrha

Subject: status of reporting at the request of the financial council during its last meeting , the coe established a swat team to assist the business units in sap reporting . this is the first of weekly status reports that we will provide . purpose : the team has begun to hold small , interactive workshops with production users to : show users how to extract data from sap by : using on - line inquiry using sap standard reports and creating and modifying a variant educate users on the sap data model and where business unit specific data resides in sap ( which module ) . better understand what additional reporting needs users may have . team structure : lead : kim lesley ( consultant ) ps : andreas kraus ( coe ) , damon willis ( consultant ) fi / co : randy parman ( coe ) , esther cortes ( consultant ) education support : maria young ( coe ) the structure of the team reflects the initial focus on project and financial reports . it has been balanced to include coe support analysts who will provide long - term customer support plus sap consultants with deep reporting knowledge . we will adjust the team members as appropriate to address the material needed by the business units . in addition to this team , susan bellinghausen and emitra nelson are continuing their efforts on 1 / 1 , 4 / 1 and 7 / 1 report development . progress : to date we have held 5 workshops with the apachi and south american regions . these workshops have been evaluated across several criteria . on a scale of 1 - 4 ( 1 = not at all and 4 = absolutely ) , the workshops have received an average rating of 3 . 6 in learning reports and increasing comfort levels . the workshops are definitely providing the one on one experience that the users are requesting . they are also seeing and learning ( hands on ) various tools that are available to them to adjust the display of reports , query the data from each module and analyze the data . the sessions are also helping to remove some of the fear associated with trying things in a new system by providing helpful tricks and hints from the experts . however , there is still a concern about increasing the understanding of where data resides within sap . this is reflected in the average rating to the key question " can sap meet your needs " being only 2 . 5 . we will further explore why the users think this is the case and what they are not getting . we are adjusting our sessions to address this and will continue to seek feedback . upcoming key activities : schedule the remaining international region sessions and the eecc home office sessions . we have the participant lists and are working on logistics . complete the analysis of the needs of the other business units in production . develop a process to follow up on these sessions to monitor the learning progress of the users . begin to evaluate a cost center reporting tool that enron europe has deployed in london . i would like to thank the active participation of the business units in identifying and providing the right group of resources to the sessions . if you have any questions or comments , feel free to address them to melissa becker , kim lesley or myself . greg

Subject: business risk management reporting as a follow up to the meeting with aa on friday , april 14 , richard and i discussed with aa ( sorrells , grutzmacher and brown ) how the monthly brm controller ' s meeting deliverables and database deliverables should be prepared . the proposal i think we should recommend to aa is the following : opening and closing meeting with front line managers and discussion of all items , regardless of priority ratings ( high , medium , low ) report generated to the business risk managers at the monthly controller meeting in the " project doorstep " style , incorporating existing controls and observations / action steps to be taken on the critical issues ( those with a high rating ) and identify responsible person ( s ) and target date follow up matrix report relating to the specific project audited in the manner consistent with the brm database indicating priority ratings ( the high issues should match the issues reported in the monthly controller meetings ) eliminate the summary report that has typically be presented at the monthly controller meetings once the " project doorstep " style report presented by aa is received at the monthly controller meeting , compliance will input the issues into the second database to enable the reminder notifications to be sent to the person ( s ) responsible for the action step . in addition , a monthly progress report will be generated from compliance to the business risk managers to show the critical ( high ) issues and implementation detail , if any . it will be imperative that aa issue final reports on the projects immediately after they have been completed and deliver the matrix within two ( 2 ) weeks after the monthly controller meetings to compliance for inputting to the brm database . if this information is not received within the two week time period , compliance will notify the brm ' s and aa of the deficiency . it will also be necessary for you , the business risk managers , to notify your front line personnel that they will be receiving the email notifications on action plans with specific target dates and with the expectation that the responsible persons will be expected to respond to the email with the status report of the issue . if you are in agreement with this reporting plan , please indicate so in a return email message to me and i will coordinate all responses and communicate this to aa . i feel that this process will provide the brm ' s the necessary information that you have indicated you want to hear in the controller ' s meetings , including the candid discussions as well as provide compliance with the necessary information to maintain the database so the information is available for the corporate needs . if you have any questions , please do not hesitate to call me at 31939 . thank you for your attention . donna lowry

Subject: fw : abs pres louise - while we were looking at opportunities for offline and the value proposition a potential software vendor might make to banks , we stumbled across " asset backed securities " and its complete lack of market making . it appears to be a very large market , controlled by " dealers " who control issuance of abs commercial paper , and among themselves control an informal secondary market . given the size of the market , and the players who seek to issue the paper ( ge , siemen , ford , credit card companies , etc . ) , i was curious as to how enron would view the opportunity . my original intention for this piece was to talk to a bank or two about how they might use our system to do this themselves and outmanuever the " controlling dealers " . also a firm has opened for business that purports to bypass the " issuance process " at a much lower cost , but has no way to help a secondary market along . if we could work with them on a " secondary market " , perhaps this could evolve . we have had some positive feedback from rahil , brandon , and tom gros but i thought you might provide an overall corporate view ! thanks - david - - - - - original message - - - - - from : knop , kara sent : friday , april 06 , 2001 9 : 27 am to : berberian , david subject : abs pres david , per our discussion , attached is the latest presentation . regards , kara

Subject: el paso schedule for 7 / 1 and 7 / 2 - extremely problematic this sheet is as complete as possible , and i am worried about it due to the following circumstances ; 1 . the dispatch sheet that comes to real time was 25 mw flat on sunday and llh on monday more than all the preschedules that were tagged today . 2 . the four corners values on that dispatch sheet changed between 5 : 15 and 5 : 42 , from 10 mw long to flat . i tried to resolve the four corners schedules with psco , who told me they did not have a purchase from epe in july . i tried calling numerous people at their office and cell phone numbers and got forwarded to enron each time . lisa had a buy resale with pnm at four corners , but that booked out and did not seem to match the 10 long that i saw in the dispatch sheet . i spoke with pete , who assured me that the sale to psco was good for the summer . 3 . i still was unable to resolve the 25 mw difference between the tags and schedules that we knew , and what the dispatch sheet said we should have for preschedule . no epe representative was available to tell me what they were expecting for the schedules , and i was referred by a dispatch person to call on saturday and speak to carlos when he came in at 4 pm . i was very uncomfortable doing this , and so in my desperation called roger at home , who after some discussion with steve at his home confirmed that the extrat 25 flat sunday and llh monday was a deal that is supposed to begin on july 3 . i trust his assesment , and have removed the extra schedule from the sheet . between all of the preschedulers today at enron , we have spent over 6 hours dealing with the epe schedules today . the sheet is as complete as i possibly can find justification for . cara semperger west power scheduling 503 / 464 - 3814
Subject: real time meeting / questions two things - 1 . weather tracking - did we decide to ask fundamentals about tracking forecasted - to - actual temperatures ? or would you me to organize this specifically for real time ? 2 . bpa transmission losses - would you prefer that we pay back losses on a daily , weekly , or monthly basis ? for billing purposes and general clarity , i think we should keep loss charges separate from actual transmission costs ( i . e . pay them back in an annuity each day , week , or month as opposed to adding them into each reservation charge - too much room for error ) . also , darin presto and casey anderson should both have 100 % access to the systems they need ; but it seems to be an ongoing process , so we ' ll keep our fingers crossed . let me know what your thoughts are on these two things . thanks , kate

Subject: california update 4 / 23 / 01 executive summary ? ferc considers price caps in the west ? davis / socal ed mou subject to legislative revisions ( we still stand by our early reports that the socal / davis transmission deal will most likely fail and that socal will follow pg & e into bankruptcy court ) ferc mitigates price spikes in the west ferc chairman hebert has placed a rto west proposal onto the agenda for this week ' s meeting . the proposal would " mitigate " price surges by requiring generating companies to sell power into california and other western states during stage 3 emergencies ( when there is less than 1 % surplus electricity in the grid ) and cap the price generators could charge during these highest states of emergency . 1 ) the ferc proposal would not set price caps for any other time than stage 3 emergencies 2 ) it would expire after a year 3 ) it would set the top reference rate at " cost plus " based on the cost to produce electricity by the most inefficient producer ferc is also looking at initiatives that would encourage the agriculture industry to possibly sell their power and natural gas contracts instead of using them to produce their products . although this proposal has not been formally approved or voted on at this time , the chairman ' s control over ferc ' s agenda is absolute and nothing gets on the agenda he does not want to consider . thus , if it stays on the agenda through meeting time , the odds of it passing are quite high if the meeting avoids total breakdown into hard - headed chaos . the key has been commissioner breathitt . the two recently nominated commissioners have not yet been approved by the senate and so cannot vote this week . thus any change in breathitt ' s position definitively tips the balance of power in ferc . davis & socal . mou not a done deal according to sources , the first legislative alteration to the davis / socal mou will involve removing the dedicated rate component necessary to repay socal ' s creditors . this point only highlights the senates ' indecision on how to deal with paying off generators . solutions currently range from seizing assets to seeking legal relief for corporate price gouging and sources indicate that the qfs are still likely to file involuntary bankruptcy against socal upon the senate ' s first official sign of unwillingness to work with creditors .

" teamwork " sue  , s a poor team player . " " when we got to  + crunch  , time sending out year - end reports , sue chose to spend a day preparing her goals for next year , instead of pitching in and helping check figures and box up reports with everyone else . we missed the shipping deadline and our reports were received a day late . this impacted our customers and caused our team to miss an important goal . " innovation " jennifer comes up with great new ideas . " " from reading an article on data transmitting devices , jennifer identified a tool she thought could be utilized in our remote gas measurement applications . now implemented , the remote measurement device has saved us significant monies and time . " leadership " tom often displays inappropriate leadership skills . " " although tom closes big deals and contributes significantly to the success of ets , he lacks the ability to gain the support and commitment of others when dealing with support groups across departmental lines . for greater success , he should listen more and provide rationale for his ideas and directives . " technical " bill  , s technical skills are weak . " " on three occasions , bill misaligned columns or overlaid critical data when updating departmental , electronic spreadsheets . these errors caused more than 30 hours of rework and approximately 8 hours of overtime to fix the mistakes .

Subject: fee for returning customers in proposed legislation a major bill for direct access at this time is sbxx 27 . this draft bill has language ( section 3 - part e ) that would allow the ca dwr to get a fee from direct access customers who return to utility service to avoid imposing costs on other customers or the state . esps would have to pay the fee if they send their customers back to bundled utility service . the fee would be " equivalent to any unvoidable costs imposed on the department ' s portfolio attributable to the load " of the returning customer . esps would be required to post a bond or demonstrate insurance coverage before they can serve customers . so far , this latter requirement only applies to esps who serve small customers , but i could envision this expanding to all esps .

Subject: fw : classic thoughts on texas a & m . . . fox sports show host jim rome 1 ) they won ' t shut up . they have to go on about spirit , and old army , and red ass , and how bonfire represents the burning sensation they have in their urine to beat ut , and blah blah blah . shut up . you start to get the feeling the entire school was built to spite ut . 2 ) forget the fact that when the texas legislature back in the 1870 ' s passed legislation to start a state university they also decided to have a subsidiary branch of the main school ( university of texas ) that would teach agriculture and mechanics . aggies love to say their school is older , from where they get that i don ' t now . . . . . . the fact is , the state intended a & m to be a branch of ut . they are like the afterbirth fromthe original creation . like danny devito in " twins " . 3 ) so they apparently have this complex , so much so , that they must devote their entire school to trying to prove to ut that they are just as good . all the while , nobody at ut denies that a & m is a good school , yet they won ' t shut up . so they write a fight song . . . . . . about ? . . . . texas , and how they want to beat them . they have a fish camp for freshman where they tell them how bad texas is and how good a & m and all its traditions are . it is the world ' s largest known case of penis envy , and it is manifested in everything a & m does . 4 ) the people at a & m . now we all have friends who went to a & m or are at a & m . there are some nice people there . however . . . there is the corp . east texas ' answer to dreams of rotc kids everywhere . for every boy scout who never learned to stop playing with his gi joe toys , there is the corp . now , forget the fact that a however , nobody respects the corp . i imagine they are kind of the laughing stock of the military world . just because you dress like the army , and try and act like the army , does not make you the army . people at a & m don ' t even respect these clowns . it is not cool to shave your head and dress up . halloween is only supposed to be one day of the year . if you want to carry guns and beat up civilians , move to israel . 5 ) it is even less cool to slobber on somebody ' s daughter on national television and call it a tradition . dry humping 18 year old girls in the stands at football games is not cool . not only is it not cool , it should be against the law . i know that in college station , students are just prone to mount each other on the campus lawn , or in the middle of class , or anytime anything good happens you can just grab the girl sitting next to you and start sucking on her face . but everywhere else in the world , it is looked down upon . especially if you are doing it on my tv . that is why we have moved the game from thanksgiving . because people across the nation were gagging on their turkey when in the middle of watching a football game , some boy scout is tongue thrashing some overweight co - ed during somebody ' s thanksgiving dinner . we do not need to see burly women engaged in a suckfest every time your woeful offense manages to put points on the board . some of these girls are in desperate need of a trip to the clinique counter . screw that , forget make - up , it is too late for that , just give them a veil . 6 ) " t . u . " is not funny . it is not insulting . it is dumb . just imagine if folks from texas kept talking about m & a and giggling . that would not be funny . in fact , it would be retarded . that ' s why ut fans don ' t do it . please learn . 7 ) you want to lose the image of country bumpkins , of a people fond of sheep , of people that aren ' t stupid ? then quit building things that fall down . quit chasing cheerleaders around with swords on national tv . quit whooping in church . quit whooping period . quit putting up scoreboards for the enjoyment of dead mammals . quit spending your friday nights practicing how to yell . quit telling rape jokes to reporters when you ' re running for governor . when you are filling out season ticket renewals , and the form asks for your phone # , h & w , quit putting 258 - 3999 , height 6 ' 3 " , weight 185 . just , collectively , stop making asses of yourselves . go to east texas , tour every small town , and ask every red neck with a 5 th grade education why they cheer for a & m and wear maroon . that is your fan base . this is why you are perceived by the educated masses as stupid . 8 ) nobody cares if you think your band is better . they might be louder , they might march in neat little zig zags , but they have no musical ability . the point is , nobody cares who wins halftime . quit getting geeked up about marching bands . i find it hard to believe you stood through your high school band ' s entire halftime performance . and why ? cause nobody cared then and nobody cares now . plus , you can hear them fine sitting down even if you do care . why is it cool all of a sudden now that you ' re in college ? 9 ) men should never let out high pitched whooping sounds . perhaps the only justifiable situation in which this can be tolerated is perhaps during an anal probe . oh wait . . . i understand now . 10 ) dogs are not ladies . they don ' t look or smell like ladies . dogs eat their own feces and should be treated accordingly . 11 ) finally , college station is an arm - pit of a town . quit pretending that it is a great college town . it is a town and there is a college there . that should be the end of this comparison . if you feel that life doesn ' t get any better than the dixie chicken , and enjoy being stuck in a never ending " dukes of hazard " episode , then move there . more importantly , don ' t move to austin . . . . . they are trying to create an educated , technological , and open minded population base . austin is , and will continue to be , the birthplace and final resting place of all that is cool . as my friend stephen johnson once said : " if the world were ever to get an enema , college station is where you would connect the hose . " if you go to school at a & m , please don ' t be an aggie . god bless the great state of texas . brian puls software engineer lockheed martin - enterprise solutions 281 218 - 2740
Subject: mark - to - market bob , i wanted to continue the analysis on mark - to - market that i had spoken to you about on the phone . i thought that it was getting very difficult explaining the whole transaction by phone , so i am having krishnarao who is in vince ' s group explain the transaction to you . krishna has been helping us structure the deal here in india , and he has just returned to houston from india after working with the team here . he will seek an appointment with you to explain the transaction . i would like you to please spend some time with him , and then based on the discussion please send us a note detailing how sucha a transaction would be marked to market . please cosider the fact that currently there are no such transactions from the indian side . this is a very important transaction for us , and we may need to repeat this in coming months , hence setting up the system to account for these maybe well worth it . also , what i am concerned about is that there will be an enron india ( eipl ) account in india based on indian gaap , and upon consolidation there will be a us gaap accounting in the us . it is here that we would like to have mark - to - market accounting . eipl is structured through mauritius , and then caymen islands . another key question to consider is that when we m - t - m the transaction in the us there will be a tax accruing in the year of m - t - m ( say 2000 ) . however , in india , as a result of the accrual accounting , there will not be any income showing till the year 2002 or 2003 . we will need to know how that would get treated , and whether there is a way to get credit for the tax payable in the us . i am also confused about whether us tax would be levied , since none of the income is being brought back into the us ( remains overseas - subpart - f and other concerns ) . finally , we have been working hard in structuring a fixed price contract and getting a fixed for floating swap in the us ( this is still not allowed to indian corporates ) . i need you to think about this too , and see if some type of accounting will solve this issue . krishna knows what i am talking about , and will brief you on the same . krishna - please walk bob through the three structures we had worked here . look forward to your help and comments . this is going to be an exciting project for us all . regards , sandeep .

1825 - - - - - original message - - - - - from : milliner , christine sent : monday , november 12 , 2001 11 : 13 am to : bajwa , bilal ; alon , heather ; fortunov , gallin ; rohmer , gisselle ; ' milliner @ gdar . org ' subject : fw : highlights from this morning ' s ene / dyn analyst conference call this was forwarded to me this morning . someone ' s notes from the call . listened in on the analyst call this morning . here are my notes . did not yet have a chance to organize them , so they ' re simply in chronological order . the call began with watson , bergstrom , and whalley reading from prepared statements . watson spoke for c . 10 minutes , bergstrom for 5 , and whalley spoke for perhaps 30 seconds . dynegy management was noticeably in control of the call . enron executives spoke when questions were directed to them . specific points : ees will be a part of the new company . enron assets will be revalued at closing . the investment in northern natural takes the form of convertible preferred . if the merger does not go through , dynegy has the right to acquire northern for ' very little ' additional consideration . if dyn terminates the merger and ene ' has sufficient liquidity ' , ene has right to repurchase the convertible preferred . debt / equity of combined company expected to be < 45 % . both companies will remain on ratingswatch negative . chevrontexaco will hold 169 mm shares out of a total 650 mm shares of the post - merger entity . watson reiterates that going forward , the new entity will be run with a focus on transparent and clear financial structure and disclosure , with a significant reduction in on - and off - balance - sheet leverage . in what was termed a " new approach " , the new entity will be run with a focus on cash flow rather than earnings . rumors that dynegy did the deal because of an unhedged exposure to enron are not true . dynegy owed enron < $ 50 mm . lay says that enron had other options , ' particularly financial ' . all of the discussion and activity has taken place over the last two weeks . lay acknowledges that the number for exposure to securities lawsuits may be ' pretty big ' , but that the companies feel they ' re able to appropriately value this exposure . lay says we have nothing else to hide , but internal investigation still under way . lay : had the spes been capitalized with perhaps $ 30 mm more of risk capital , there would have been no question that they would have qualified for off - balance - sheet treatment and there would have been no need to restate earnings last week to reflect consolidation of the spes . dynegy says that ' several ' internal investigations continue at enron , and thus dyn / ene cannot say with certainty that there ' s absolutely nothing else out there . doty ( dynegy cfo ) says that late last week , ene had ' close to a billion ' in cash . osprey will be unwound late next summer . marlin will be unwound after closing . many of the off - balance - sheet structures , including the credit - linked notes , are expected to be unwound / redeemed or at least significantly reduced prior to closing . with regard to ene asset dispositions , these will be accelerated to the extent possible . however , doty says that ' our backs are not against the wall ' , and the company will continue to focus on getting value for its assets as well as cash . ene will renew its 364 - day facility ( believe this is the $ 3 bn facility that we drew down a couple of weeks ago ) within the next 6 - 8 weeks . bbb - flat most likely rating for combined entity , according to initial comments from ratings agencies . mcmahon says ' no comment ' to wsj article indicating that ene ' s banks are preparing to make an equity infusion into ene in the next few weeks . consolidation of trading activity : mid - and back - office consolidation will see substantial progress prior to closing , such that only the front office / trading books will need to be combined at closing . ees , nng and tw have no real overlap with existing dyn activity , so there won ' t be much integration work required there . the big integration effort will be ena . watson says that the ' creative financing ' surrounded non - core assets . doty adds that , ' frankly ' , dyn assigned zero economic value to non - core businesses in their valuation model ( uh - oh ) . they bracketed the maximum expected exposure from the non - core assets / businesses and left it at that . watson mentions that dyn would not have gotten involved with enron had they not been approached by ' enron ' s top three executives ' , who said that they thought a combination with dynegy made the most strategic sense for both companies . says that their approach evidenced a willingness to work with dyn to integrate the two companies that made a big difference in dynegy ' s deliberations on proceeding with the merger . watson / doty said that they ' re not 100 % sure that no surprises remain in enron ' s books - - but that the risk / reward offered by the combination was compelling . the deal does have material - adverse - change outs for dynegy , covering any mac regarding enron ' s assets or businesses . dynegy ' s lawyers indicated that the mac language was a ' blunt instrument ' under which it would be difficult to bring a case , so dynegy inserted a specific paragraph that gives dynegy the right to terminate the merger if the enron ' s total legal liability ( from any source or cause of action ) tops $ 3 . 5 bn prior to closing . mcmahon adds that there ' could ' be more restatements , but he ' does not expect ' there to be more restatements . ene international hard assets definitely on the asset disposition list . the merger structure calls for a new entity to take over enron . enron is planning to hold an enron - specific conference call in the next few days , tentatively scheduled for wednesday . initial reaction of ratings agencies ' very positive ' to combined entities . mcmahon acknowledges that enron would have had to have an additional equity infusion prior to year - end , had the merger not materialized . dynegy ' s earnings guidance places enron - related earnings accretion at $ 0 . 90 - 0 . 95 , which represents a ' 25 % haircut ' to enron internal estimates . doty says that this is all operating earnings - - figure does not include any amounts from expected synergies . doty says that both enron and dynegy ' s books , as far as he understands , are relatively short - term in weight , and this will continue to be the weighting of the new entity . says a ' very very substantial ' portion of future trading earnings will be expected to be cash . chevrontexaco ' s investment in dynegy was calculated at a 5 % discount to public prices on the date of negotiation ( not disclosed ) . given the runup in dynegy stock last week , chevrontexaco ' s investment is now at a ' more substantial ' discount to market prices . chevrontexaco has provision to get ' different prices at closing if those prices are substantially better ' . ( no further clarification given ) . whalley believes that ' we ' ll retain ' the enron traders and marketers . they ' re used to being part of a winning team , and the combined entity will definitely be a winner . they have talked with most of the enron business leaders , and they are ' very excited ' by the combination . they will be working with the enron business leaders to ensure talent is retained . whalley was asked if there will be any key employee retention provisions . he says that ' to the extent necessary , yes . ' watson says that the trading strategy of the combined entity will be a combination of dyn and ene - - there will be more of an asset - backed trading focus , but by the same token the new dynegy will be involved in much more financial market - making trading than the dynegy of today . watson says that if there were to be any change in culture , he ' s a strong team player . he does not want to see an individual do well if the company or division does not do well . give me a call if you ' d like me to try to clarify any of these comments . patrick tucker x 3 - 3055

Subject: california update 5 / 4 / 01 if you have any questions , please contact kristin walsh at ( 713 ) 853 - 9510 . bridge loan financing bills may not meet their may 8 th deadline due to lack of support sources report there will not be a vote regarding the authorization for the bond issuance / bridge loan by the may 8 th deadline . any possibility for a deal has reportedly fallen apart . according to sources , both the republicans and democratic caucuses are turning against davis . the democratic caucus is reportedly " unwilling to fight " for davis . many legislative republicans and democrats reportedly do not trust davis and express concern that , once the bonds are issued to replenish the general fund , davis would " double dip " into the fund . clearly there is a lack of good faith between the legislature and the governor . however , it is believed once davis discloses the details of the power contracts negotiated , a bond issuance will take place . additionally , some generator sources have reported that some of the long - term power contracts ( as opposed to those still in development ) require that the bond issuance happen by july 1 , 2001 . if not , the state may be in breach of contract . sources state that if the legislature does not pass the bridge loan legislation by may 8 th , having a bond issuance by july lst will be very difficult . the republicans were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the state would " eat " the $ 5 billion cost of power spent to date out of the general fund , thereby decreasing the amount of the bond issuance to approximately $ 8 billion . however , the reportedly now are not going to offer even this concession . sources report that the republicans intend to hold out for full disclosure of the governor ' s plan for handling the crisis , including the details and terms of all long - term contracts he has negotiated , before they will support the bond issuance to go forward . currently there are two bills dealing with the bridge loan ; ab 8 x and ab 31 x . ab 8 x authorizes the dwr to sell up to $ 10 billion in bonds . this bill passed the senate in march , but has stalled in the assembly due to a lack of republican support . ab 31 x deals with energy conservation programs for community college districts . however , sources report this bill may be amended to include language relevant to the bond sale by senator bowen , currently in ab 8 x . senator bowen ' s language states that the state should get paid before the utilities from rate payments ( which , if passed , would be likely to cause a socal bankruptcy ) . according to sources close to the republicans in the legislature , republicans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money available in the general fund . for instance , tony strickland has stated that only 1 / 2 of the bonds ( or approximately $ 5 billion ) should be issued . other republicans reportedly do not support issuing any bonds . the republicans intend to bring this up in debate on monday . additionally , lehman brothers reportedly also feels that a bridge loan is unnecessary and there are some indications that lehman may back out of the bridge loan . key points of the bridge financing initial loan amount : $ 4 . 125 b lenders : jp morgan $ 2 . 5 b lehman brothers $ 1 . 0 b bear stearns $ 625 m tax exempt portion : of the $ 4 . 125 b ; $ 1 . 6 b is expected to be tax - exempt projected interest rate : taxable rate 5 . 77 % tax - exempt rate 4 . 77 % current projected blended ir : 5 . 38 % maturity date : august 29 , 2001 for more details please contact me at ( 713 ) 853 - 9510 bill sb 6 x passed the senate yesterday , but little can be done at this time the senate passed sb 6 x yesterday , which authorizes $ 5 billion to create the california consumer power and conservation authority . the $ 5 billion authorized under sb 6 x is not the same as the $ 5 billion that must be authorized by the legislature to pay for power already purchased , or the additional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasing power going forward . again , the republicans are not in support of these authorizations . without the details of the long - term power contracts the governor has negotiated , the republicans do not know what the final bond amount is that must be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to support . no further action can be taken regarding the implementation of sb 6 x until it is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paid for purchasing power . also , there is no staff , defined purpose , etc . for the california public power and conservation authority . however , this can be considered a victory for consumer advocates , who began promoting this idea earlier in the crisis . socal edison and bankruptcy at this point , two events would be likely to trigger a socal bankruptcy . the first would be a legislative rejection of the mou between socal and the governor . the specified deadline for legislative approval of the mou is august 15 th , however , some decision will likely be made earlier . according to sources , the state has yet to sign the mou with socal , though socal has signed it . the republicans are against the mou in its current form and davis and the senate lack the votes needed to pass . if the legislature indicates that it will not pas the mou , socal would likely file for voluntary bankruptcy ( or its creditor - involuntary ) due to the lack operating cash . the second likely triggering event , which is linked directly to the bond issuance , would be an effort by senator bowen to amend sb 31 x ( bridge loan ) stating that the dwr would received 100 % of its payments from ratepayers , then the utilities would receive the residual amount . in other words , the state will get paid before the utilities . if this language is included and passed by the legislature , it appears likely that socal will likely file for bankruptcy . socal is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities and the dwr proportionately from rate payments .

Subject: ngi article on tw hearing ( after first day ) transwestern denies withheld capacity to boost negotiated deals a transwestern pipeline executive yesterday dismissed allegations that the pipeline withheld firm transportation capacity bound for california from its recourse - rate shippers last winter in order to free up more capacity for contracts at substantially higher negotiated rates . mary kay miller , vice president of rates and certificates , acknowledged transwestern may have had discussions and exchanged faxes ( prior to posting its available capacity ) with two shippers - - sempra energy and richardson products ii ltd . - - that subsequently entered into negotiated - rate transactions . but she stressed that requests for capacity by sempra energy and richardson were considered " moot " by the pipeline until after the available operational capacity was posted . " even if they would have sent . . . a fax the day before " capacity became available , " it would have been irrelevant because there was no capacity posted " at that time , said miller . capacity requests that came in prior to jan . 31 , the day that available capacity was posted for february contracts on transwestern , were " null and void . " the only " relevant " ones were those that transwestern received on or after jan . 31 , she noted . miller spent much of wednesday on the stand being quizzed by lawyers for ferc and producers about transwestern ' s methods for notifying customers about available capacity , the manner in which it chooses winning bids and about its pre - posting contacts with sempra energy and richardson . it was the first day of a ferc hearing exploring charges that transwestern exercised market power in awarding negotiated - rate contracts that led to shippers being charged as much as $ 27 / mmbtu last february , far in excess of the pipeline ' s maximum allowed rate of 38 cents / mmbtu for firm transportation service to the california border . the commission proceeding yesterday focused on four negotiated - rate contracts of sempra energy and richardson for a total 45 , 000 mmbtu / d of service on transwestern during february and march . richardson and sempra " clearly did not have any ' deal ' entitling them to the posted capacity before it was posted , " miller said in prepared rebuttal testimony . the two companies " had the right to the capacity only ' after ' they submitted their bids , ' after ' the posting period ended , ' after ' transwestern determined that no other bids were submitted , and ' after ' a contract was agreed upon between transwestern , richardson or sempra , " she noted . despite claims made by ferc energy industry analyst barry e . sullivan to the contrary , " transwestern did not withhold capacity that otherwise could have been made available under recourse rates in order to make the capacity available under substantially higher negotiated rates , " miller testified . sullivan , an analyst in the ferc office of markets , tariffs and rates ' ( omtr ) division of litigation , contends that transwestern threatened to withhold capacity unless shippers agreed to negotiated rates . in fact , he believes the pre - posting discussions between transwestern and shippers were intended to raise doubts about the availability of capacity at the maximum recourse rate , so that shippers might be more " willing to enter into negotiated - rate contracts above the recourse rate , in the hope of securing some of the capacity if and when [ it became ] available . " but miller counters that sullivan " offers not support for his claim . " she noted that even sempra energy and richardson , in response to a data request by southern california edison , support transwestern ' s claims . both companies replied " no " when asked whether " any employee of transwestern or any transwestern affiliate ever indicated at any time that transwestern would not provide the capacity at the maximum tariff rate . " the " capacity at issue was offered on transwestern ' s web site at the recourse rate in the exact same manner that all other capacity is offered on transwestern ' s web site at the recourse rate ; there was no prohibition , restrictions , limitation , condition or suggestion that a potential shipper could not bid for the capacity at the recourse rate ; and any potential shipper , including richardson or sempra , could have submitted a bid for the capacity at the recourse rate . " sullivan contends that transwestern ' s motive for allegedly advancing negotiated - rate transactions at the expense of recourse - rate deals was pure profit . under questioning by thomas j . burgess of ferc ' s omtr , miller conceded that transwestern earned $ 1 . 8 million from sempra energy ' s contract in march , $ 1 . 3 million from richardson ' s march contract , and a " comparable " amount from richardson ' s february contract . she noted the pipeline received a " substantially higher " amount as a result of sempra ' s february contract , but she didn ' t provide an exact figure . ferc ' s sullivan estimated the pipeline ' s profit from the sempra february contract was more than $ 5 million . sullivan said that much of the profits that wound up in transwestern ' s coffers would have gone to sempra energy and richardson if they have been able to acquire the capacity at recourse rates . but miller countered that the commission ' s negotiated - rate policy " does not require a minimum level of profit to shippers or contemplate any hindsight analysis of whether shippers could have gotten a better deal or made more profits . " furthermore , she said the transwestern case shouldn ' t be used to consider changes to the negotiated - rate policy , as sullivan has suggested . this case " is the wrong forum for such an issue because modifying the negotiated - rate policy should only be done on an industry - wide basis so no pipeline or group of pipeline customers is competitively disadvantaged . "
Subject: re : peer group mapping steve kean and i believe quite strongly , within a four peer group structure , that we need to allocate somewhere between 30 and 50 percent of gov ' t . / public affairs out of commercial support into specialized technical - there is a clear divide between individuals in the gov ' t / public affairs groups who are managing significant risk for the company and having a significant and direct impact on commercial activities / net income ( these individuals should be moved to specialized technical ) . . . . and others who are performing a less strategic function ( who should remain in the commercial support category ) . with that said , it is probably not necessary to undertake this effort for mid - year prc purposes since we are probably moving to a three peer stucture where that split could be achieved ( for year - end purposes where the compensation impact would be felt ) . if we stay with the four group stucture , i intend to push hard for the remapping of gov ' t affairs by year - end . on a completely seperate issue , i continue to be very concerned about the impact of the " preferred " distribution relative to the bottom category for " commercial support " groups ( i ' m not implying this is ' nt an issue for commercial groups - i just don ' t have the same ability to assess the impact there ) . . . . the concern , simply stated , is that it may be entirely counterproductive to force individuals who are not performance problems into a category that has significant implications for their careers here at enron , particularly after going thru the past year where many of the non -

Subject: re : enpower i have not personally talked to james about these issues in enpower . his concerns regarding swaptions and asian options are accurate . it is currently working on new volatility curves for swaptions to use . it is also working on correlations in order for asian options to be valued properly . london trades many more swaptions and asian options than the us ; therefore , the impact of not having swaption volatility curves and correlations is greater to them . the majority of options in the u . s . are european monthly and daily exercises and the current volatility curves adequately take care of these deals . the idea of swaption volatility curves has floated around in the us , but other more material items always got in the way and we continue to use the deal specific volatilities for the swaptions we do have . once the technology is in place to use swaption volatilities we will also adopt . the system was originally built to handle the physical power world that existed in the us and as new markets and new ideas ( such as the us becoming more and more of a financial market ) we will need to enhance enpower to follow suit . swaption vols and asian options are two of these enhancements . also , it is difficult to get option data out of enpower . we have in stage an option sensitivity matrix that , once implemented into production . i will be sure that james knows about . it probably will not solve all his problems , but it will give him a starting place . stacey enron north america corp . from : sally beck 12 / 11 / 2000 11 : 00 am to : stacey w white / hou / ect @ ect cc : subject : enpower in cleaning up e : mails , i ran across this one that i had not yet read . has james called and talke with you about enpower ?

despite the above we have now persuaded the traders to save out newer higher volatilities a week ago and you should have seen a large move up in their var . however , as it stands at the moment they are notable to save out a daily remark as jitendra is saying that he is not happy with their ' model ' / vol curve generator ( i have today asked for a full explanation , details of any testing etc etc and time lines so we can move to getting over this hurdle ) . the swaptions have also not yet had the ticket volatility changed but the impacts are expected to be positive as we are long volatility . i would appreciate your comments on the above as it seems that we are pushing the boundaries here on areas which we really expect to have already been covered in houston some time ago and could do with some help . we are having to use a system which seems to us to have numerous bugs and short comings and are having to spend an enormous amount of it time overcoming the inadequacies of enpower wich i do not think most people are aware of . consequently we have not been able to deliver all the improvements we were required to do in gaining the increased limits so 3 months ago but i would hope you agree that it is not for a lack of trying . sorry it ' s so long but if there are any questions or any perceived inaccuracies in any of the above then please let me know . james

Subject: e nymex : market forces - enymex still on launchpad . market forces - enymex still on launchpad . 09 / 07 / 2001 energy compass ( c ) 2001 energy intelligence group . all rights reserved the new york mercantile exchange has been thinking about shifting some of its business online since early last year - - and possibly before that - when it was invited to join the electronic ( ice ) . it rejected the offer - which rival international petroleum exchange has since gladly accepted - instead unveiling plans last may to build its own electronic trading platform for over - the - counter and smaller futures contracts . but its cyberspace initiative is still on the launchpad . called enymex , the online system was supposed to launch in october 2000 , at the same time as the big oil - backed ice . but october came and went , and while ice appeared , enymex failed to show . its start date was pushed back to late 2000 - and then to the first quarter of 2001 , and then to the second quarter of this year . nymex held to that second - quarter target for months , before again failing to deliver . it ' s now given up on the third quarter as well , and exchange executives have stopped trying to predict when the electronic trading platform will be ready to go . that ' s not the only blow to nymex ' s e - trade strategy . delays are also plaguing an internet version of its existing access after - hours electronic trading system , although it remains available as a proprietary , dial - up system to existing customers . late last month , nymex announced plans to make access available over the internet - at www . nymexaccess . com - in a move designed to widen its customer base . but just a few days before the planned sep . 3 start date , the exchange pulled back ( ec aug . 31 , p 3 ) . as with enymex , a new date has yet to be scheduled . launched in 1993 , the dial - up version of access handled 2 . 1 million contracts last year , equal to 2 % of nymex ' s total trading volume . nymex executives say that putting access on the web could triple the volume of business completed on the platform . the exchange ' s new brent crude oil futures contract and other existing pit - traded contracts are available on access . compared with ice - which is steadily unveiling new services and products on its e - trade system - the new york exchange ' s path to building an electronic platform has been bumpy . earlier this year , nymex ended its relationship with accenture ( formerly andersen consulting ) , which had been involved in managing the exchange ' s transition to an electronic trading platform almost from the start . some observers characterized the move as a cost - cutting measure ; nymex says accenture was dismissed because its work was done . nymex blames many of the delays on globalview software , one of its technology partners , with which it is involved in a bitter legal dispute . in april , nymex filed a breach of contract lawsuit in a new york court against globalview , alleging that the chicago - based software firm had stopped work on enymex , and seeking unspecified damages . globalview chief executive jon olson admits that his company did indeed stop work , but says it was because nymex stopped paying . it is countersuing , seeking around $ 26 million for fees and damages . nymex president bo collins is also claiming that globalview has gone bankrupt . but olson says business is good for the 20 - year - old company , which has around 150 clients in the energy industry . with globalview off the project , nymex has decided it will build the " front - end " piece of enymex - the part that globalview was working on . when it ' s all complete , nymex will have an e - trade platform for derivatives and smaller futures contracts , and a separate e - trade service for its after - hours customers . it will also have its existing pit - traded contracts , which it has no intention of ditching . with so many different pieces , some observers wonder what nymex is up to . collins , a one - time natural gas trader at us - based el paso , responds that nymex aims to build an " electronic cloud " around its successful pit contracts . rather than disrupt a successful business , collins says the exchange is creating new , electronic trading opportunities around its pit - traded products . " the reality is we have a system of pit trading that provides immense liquidity to the market , " he says . " so i have got to figure out a way to marry the technology to the humanness of the process . " for example , nymex ' s henry hub natural gas futures contract is successful , and several types of contracts trade on other exchanges based on the henry hub price . that ' s where enymex will come in , collins says : the e - trade platform will offer spread and basis swaps contracts based on prices of nymex ' s pit contracts - thus marrying technology and the trading pit . some observers suggest that the enymex roll - out has taken a back seat to the exchange ' s newest product , a brent crude oil futures contract challenging the ipe . the new contract , which started trading on sep . 5 , was joined the following day by a new brent options contract . on sep . 7 , the new york exchange started offering a brent - wti spread options contract . the battle for the hearts and minds of brent traders will rage in the traditional trading pits of new york and london for another year , at least . but over the next 12 - 18 months , all of the ipe ' s business will be shifted online to a futures trading platform being built by ice . the ipe ' s strategy is clear . by agreeing to be acquired by ice , the london exchange obviously sees a future where commodities trading takes place in cyberspace - not in a trading pit . nymex is betting that its " electronic cloud " strategy - whereby e - trade is married with pit trading - will pay off . in the end , though , the e - trade versus pit trade battle being waged by the world ' s two biggest oil futures exchanges may become secondary to the battle for brent . if nymex can create liquidity in its new brent contract , its bumpy path toward e - trade may be forgotten . by jeff gosmano , houston . folder name : e nymex relevance score on scale of 100 : 95 to review or revise your folder , visit or contact dow jones customer service by e - mail at custom . news @ bis . dowjones . com or by phone at 800 - 369 - 7466 .

Subject: var for metals it is my preference to have an aggregated var methodology for the metals business as soon as possible ( version la ) . i do not want to poison progress with my opiniion , but i think that the critical first step is to find a way to aggregate positions in coarse buckets , perhaps sacrificing precision for speed , based on " rules " that oerations can deliver , research can stand behind and commercial will accept . , and using an equally coarse var calculation ( the equivalent of ad - hoc var ? ) that can be delivered to the " official books and records " on a daily basis . this i believe would be acceptable for a 2 - 3 month time frame ( at which time we get versionlb ) as opposed to waiting 2 - 3 months to implement a better process and have nothing in the interim . ultimately , i would look for version 2 a to be delivered and very defendable by 1 / 1 / 01 . this will require indulgence and compromise on all fronts but i cannot conceive of a better way . please let me know if this is consistent with your understanding . a critical point from my perspective is that the mg commercial team and metal operations staff understand their role in making this happen and willingness to accept the consequences . i look for you to take the lead as leader of the integration to do so . if you need any input from the rest of us to underscore the importance please let us know . as i alluded to on the phone , the people in houston that have been involved in the var process have been through an extraordinary period of detailed scrutiny of var by commercial and have been hindered by the lack of basic understanding by all parties as their responsibilities . given the distance and the newness of the metals personell , i fear that this could set us all up for some surprises and some very uncomfortable communication , much of which is not entirely necessary . thanks ted eric gadd 07 / 21 / 2000 11 : 46 am to : ted murphy / hou / ect @ ect , bjorn hagelmann / hou / ect @ ect cc : richard sage / lon / ect @ ect subject : attached fax ted and bjorn - we plan to release draft recommendations on metal position limits by close of business on 24 july and have asked vince to prepare a v @ r computational methodology prior to the 7 / 8 aug bod meeting .

mail . my phone number is ( 617 ) 492 - 9551 . i graduated from princeton university in 1996 ( mathematics ) , and came straight to mit for a ph . d . in operations management at the sloan schoolof management . in my first three years i took all the required coursework in mathematics , optimization , stochastic processes , etc . , as well as a number of courses in psychology ( at mit and harvard ) . i am working with prof . gabriel bitran , and i am interested in the mathematical modeling of service operations . in particular , i am interested in the interaction between customers and companies ( hence the interest in psychology ) . the ( tentative ) title of my phd thesis is " pricing substitute products on the internet " , and i am sending you the summary which i sent to tom gros a few weeks ago that will give you an idea of what this research is about . thanks again , and i ' m looking forward to meeting you and your research group next week . paulo pricing substitute products on the internet objective : to develop new tools to decide pricing policies for goods and services sold on the internet . motivation : this research is motivated by the fact that traditional choice and optimization models are not appropriate for internet - related businesses . the technological innovations associated with the internet brought about an overload of information which inevitably affects the ways in which consumers make choices . furthermore , companies have a great deal of influence on how much information consumers can have access to . the problem of pricing substitute products is an important strategic issue faced by internet companies . consumers usually search for generic products ( e . g . vcrs or computers ) without knowing exactly what they will buy . companies can show different products and different prices to each consumer . this type of flexibility was not available until the internet came about . the problem of pricing substitute products is not unique to the internet . the methodology developed by this research should be transferable to a number of other settings , such as pricing services . services are unique , and there are many cases where customers will only buy one of many services offered by a given company . our model will help companies decide which services to offer to which customers and how much to charge for these services . research strategy : our research strategy is to divide the pricing problem into two components which can be combined to generate optimal pricing strategies . these components are choice models and optimization models . choice models : choice models describe how customers make choices . the management literature draws on two main sources for these models : psychology and economics . the common approach in psychology models is to use what are called heuristic elimination methods . these methods consist of the elimination of options based on the sequential elimination of features until only one choice remains . these methods tend to be very context - specific and do not lend themselves very easily to mathematical analysis . economists focus on utility - maximing models that are significantly more mathematically tractable than psychological models . the most common economic model of choice is the logit model . the problem with these types of models is that they are not very accurate reflections of how consumer make choices on the internet . the first step in our research will be to develop choice models that capture the interactions going on between customers and companies on the internet . optimization : traditionally , the optimization problem consists of maximizing revenue over a certain planning horizon . on the internet , the problem of maximizing revenue still exists , but there is also a need to learn about customers . short term profit is based on sales , but long term profit is based on how well you know your customers and are able to retain them . the optimization problem must therefore include a short term component ( sales ) and a long term component ( learning ) .
Subject: possible temporary move of hpl to three allen according to facilities the 4 th floor of three allen will be available starting april lst . i just finished a walk through of the space and have the following comments about possibly moving hpl on to the floor : it is a mezzanine type floor which has overhangs which are open to the elevator lobby down below . we ' d need to stick trading and logistics into some of the large offices or joining conference rooms to keep them away from the lobby noise . there are currently only 70 ports or network connections on the floor . we ' d need to pull additional cable to handle the approximately 150 people that would need to be on the floor . if we decide so to use the floor we could get this done within a couple of weeks at most . the floor is set up with mostly offices and very few cubes . we ' d need to put together several people in each office to fit everyone into the space . if we put more than one person in the office the fire code we require us to put a strobe in each office set up this way . there is no telecom or wiring closet on the floor . that means to make this work as is hpl would have to remain on our network and depend on us for telecom service via our nortel switch during the stay in three allen since there would be nowhere for aep to put servers or switches on the floor without any major build out . there is no set up for the ipc trader phones and currently no room to add an ipc rack on the 5 th floor telecom closet . we would have to either knock out a wall on the 5 th floor closet or tell the traders to live without recorded phone conversations . the good news is that keith dziadek and his team have figured out a way to make the eol connection with aep work that will have minimal impact to eol . we could use this link for hpl to access their trade blotter , risk systems and people soft from aep . bottom line : the space on 4 is not ideal but it is available . i will be receiving a floor plan today and will kindly forward a copy on to someone within your group to work with bill donovans group to see if there is anyway to get 150 people on the floor . there will be some costs to set things up like additional cabling and installing some additional desks or workstations . if we decide that trader phones are necessary then we would have to expand the 5 th floor wiring closet . if we decide to do this we may need to purchase an ipc switch , system and phones . it cost me $ 60 , 000 when i purchased an ipc system for bridgeline . i will also check to see if we have a switch anywhere that we could borrow for a few months . we need to decide very quickly if this is what we want to do if we are shooting for having people over in three allen for the april bid week for may production . we also need to talk about this additional cost with aep and having them pick some or all of it up . we also need to have aep on board because they are building their side of the interfaces with our systems . if the interfaces are not ready in time then the traders would need to enter trades into both sitara and aep ' s risk system . the bigger issue would be the interface with aep ' s peoplesoft system since they would be generating payments via this application . the good news is that may production for physical trades will not settle until june giving them extra time to finish the interface . our side of the interfaces are pretty simple and i feel confident we will be ready to test in april . let me know if you need any additional information . - tommy

Subject: energycast dear vince , i hope your trip to australia was successful . it ' s one of my favorite places to go . i ' ve copied you on the email to mike initiating enron ' s trial service to energycast . thanks for helping to set this up . would you ask the authorities in enron to refresh my access to enrononline ? my guest user id as ena 61296 and my guest password was tr 84 byl 3 . they no longer work , probably because i haven ' t visited the site in months as we were in full development mode on energycast . vince , you will note in our website references to forward prices of power in nepool , nypp , and pjm . we use reuters as a reference - - not satisfactory . if your traders like energycast and enron became a client , would enron consider linking its prices to our site ? we have to improve over the reuters quotes and regard enrononline or bloomberg as the best candidates . over time , as our service spreads i believe this could help generate deal flow for your traders . let me know what you think . ed
Subject: data for moody ' s riskcalc craig and kim , as you know , i have obtained a 60 day trial subscription to moody ' s riskcalc . you wanted to know if it makes sense for enron to purchase riskcalc . well , after plowing through their 100 page manual and sitting through today ' s 2 - hour moody ' s presentation , it is necessary for us to have information about enron ' s counterparties to move to the next step with riskcalc . we have obtained some information on enron ' s european counterparties from our colleagues in the london office . we need for you and / or your colleagues in the houston office to supply us with a list of enron ' s north american counterparties . more specifically , to evaluate moody ' s riskcalc we will need the following financial inputs for enron ' s north american ( private firm ) counterparties : fiscal year the prior twelve months of financial data are represented . annual statements are usable as well as quarterly statements after summing the flow variables , such as cost of goods sold , net income , sales , and ebit . the value should be a four - digit integer year without mention of the day or month such as 1999 or 2000 . forecasts until the year 2009 can be made . a constant rate of inflation is applied to future years using last year ' s ( 1999 ) inflation level . in general this ' estimation error ' will not cause any great problems , as size affects default rates at very large scales ( e . g . , $ 10 , 000 , 000 vs . $ 1 , 000 , 000 makes a significant difference , $ 1 , 000 , 000 vs . $ 1 , 050 , 00 does not ) . cash & equivalents this measure of liquid assets includes cash and marketable securities . inventory inventories are taken directly from the balance sheet , in thousands dollars , without any alterations for accounting method ( e . g . , lifo , fifo , average cost ) . this item represents merchandise bought for resale and materials and supplies purchased for use in production of revenue . specifically this would include purchase cost , sales cost , sales taxes , transportation costs , insurance costs , and storage costs . current assets this item primarily represents cash , inventories , accounts receivables , marketable securities , and other current assets . total assets total assets and every other variable are entered in thousands of dollars . for example , $ 15 , 500 , 000 should be entered as 15500 . specifically , total assets are the sum of current assets plus net property , plant , and equipment plus other noncurrent assets ( including intangible assets , deferred items , and investments and advances ) . leave previous year ' s total assets blank for australian companies . current liabilities liabilities are positive values . included in current liabilities are short - term debt , accounts payable , and other current liabilities . total liabilities this balance sheet account , total liabilities , is a positive number representing the sum of current liabilities plus long - term debt plus other noncurrent liabilities ( including deferred taxes , investment tax credit , and minority interest ) . retained earnings retained earnings , a historical measure of performance , is the cumulative earnings of the company less total dividend distributions to shareholders . typically , it is the prior year ' s retained earnings plus net income less distributions . retained earnings are generally positive . some firms with low credit quality will have negative retained earnings . leave this field blank for australian companies . sales this item consists of the industry segment ' s gross sales ( the amount of actual billings to customers for regular sales completed during the period ) reduced by cash discounts , trade discounts , and returned sales and allowances for which credit is given to customers . cost of goods sold entered in thousands of dollars , this value is generally a positive number less than sales . it represents all costs directly allocated by the company to production , such as material , labor , and overhead . not fixed overhead or items that would be included in selling , general , and administrative expenses . leave this field blank for australian companies . ebit earning before interest expense is operating income after depreciation . it can be positive or negative but is usually greater then net income . interest expense this item represents the periodic expense to the company of securing short - and long - term debt . typically , we expect this charge to be approximately the prevailing interest rate times the total liabilities . one measure of computing this is : interest expense = 0 . 07 * total liabilities . net income this item represents the income ( or loss ) reported by a company after expenses and losses have been subtracted from all revenues and gains for the fiscal period including extraordinary items and discontinued operations . a loss is represented by a negative sign . for example , a $ 5 , 000 , 000 loss would be entered as - 5000 . leave previous year ' s net income blank for australian companies . extraordinary items positive or negative , this item represents unusual items that sometimes appear on the income statement . the items are designated by the company as extraordinary and presented after net income from continuing operations and discontinued operations . these items include extraordinary gains / losses , income ( loss ) from discontinued operations , and cumulative affect of accounting changes . expenses are entered as negative values , gains as positive values . leave previous year ' s extraordinary items blank for australian companies . country this model is calibrated for the united states , canada , and australia . we look forward to receiving this information for enron ' s private firm north american counterparties so that we can move on to the next step with the evaluation of riskcalc . thanks , iris

" enron makes the market . make no mistake about that , " said merrill lynch analyst donato eassey . " there ' s not a trader out there that doesn ' t use enrononline . " as such , enron enters into thousands of transactions every day in which the company ' s credit - worthiness is critical . enron said its business operations were functioning normally yesterday . the company also has consistently said it is financially strong and liquid . enron said its new chief financial officer is jeffrey mcmahon , the 40 - year - old head of the company ' s industrial - markets division . his selection may be intended , in part , to raise the company ' s credibility . people familiar with the matter say mr . mcmahon left his job as treasurer last year after voicing concerns within the company about mr . fastow ' s role in running two limited partnerships that were involved in billions of dollars worth of transactions with enron . internal partnership documents indicate mr . fastow and possibly a handful of associates made millions of dollars from the partnerships . mr . fastow severed his ties with those partnerships in july in the face of increasing conflict - of - interest concerns being expressed by wall street analysts and major enron investors . on monday , enron announced that the securities and exchange commission was looking into the fastow - related transactions . while enron as recently as tuesday strongly defended mr . fastow , as well as the company ' s dealings with the partnerships , controversy over those arrangements clearly played a role in the executive ' s departure . " in my continued discussions with the financial community , it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace andy as cfo , " said chairman and chief executive kenneth lay in a prepared statement . enron said mr . fastow " will be on a leave of absence from the company . " he couldn ' t be reached for comment . it remains to be seen how much mr . fastow ' s removal will assuage an increasingly restive investment community . the action came after the 4 p . m . market close and followed a day in which enron ' s stock once again plunged . as of 4 p . m . in new york stock exchange composite trading , enron shares were at $ 16 . 41 , down $ 3 . 38 , or 17 % . it topped the big board ' s most active list at nearly 76 million shares , more than twice the volume of the second - most - active stock . several trades yesterday involved blocks of 800 , 000 shares or more , possibly indicating that some institutional holders are souring on enron stock . enron ' s shares are down about 50 % from the beginning of last week . earlier this year , the stock was above $ 80 a share . in an apparent ripple effect , the stocks of other energy - trading companies , which do business with enron , also fell sharply yesterday . for instance , dynegy inc . shares on the big board were off $ 5 . 45 , or 13 % , at $ 37 . 26 . a number of the energy companies hit by the selloff have business strategies much different than enron ' s , which rely heavily on complex and highly structured investment vehicles . prudential securities analyst carol coale said mr . fastow ' s departure could be seen as evidence that " management does care " about investor concerns . however , she adds , the move also could be viewed by some investors , coming as it did two days after the announcement of the sec inquiry , as " an admission of guilt . " ms . coale yesterday issued a sell recommendation on enron largely because of uncertainties about the company ' s extremely complex financial structure . enron has consistently denied any wrongdoing in its fastow - related dealings . worries and rumors about enron ' s financial strength could be found in the stock market yesterday . goldman sachs analyst david fleischer said he heard people voice concerns about a possible " death spiral " in which increasing credit concerns about enron would decrease the number of people willing to do business with the company , which would in turn weaken its finances and lead to further business reductions . mr . fleischer , a longtime fan who still has a buy recommendation on the company , said he hasn ' t yet seen any evidence of such a problem . however , mr . fleischer said , enron needs to disclose more information about its myriad of financial transactions with related partnerships and other entities . enron is facing a problem with " trust and credibility . it ' s not easy to regain something as basic as trust , " he said . copyright ? 2000 dow jones section c enron ousts finance chief as s . e . c . looks at dealings by floyd norris 10 / 25 / 2001 the new york times page 2 , column 5 c . 2001 new york times company the enron corporation , its stock battered by a sudden loss of investor confidence , yesterday ousted its chief financial officer , andrew s . fastow , whose involvement in complicated transactions with enron has drawn the scrutiny of the securities and exchange commission . ' ' in my continued discussions with the financial community , it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace andy as c . f . o . , ' ' kenneth l . lay , enron ' s chairman and chief executive , said in a statement announcing the change . only one day before , mr . lay had told investors in a conference call that he and the enron board ' ' continue to have the highest faith and confidence in andy . ' ' the company said that mr . fastow had taken a leave of absence , but it also named his successor , jeffrey mcmahon , the head of enron ' s industrial markets group and a former corporate treasurer . enron said none of the officials were available for interviews last night . the move came after the close of trading on the new york stock exchange , where enron ' s shares fell $ 3 . 38 , to $ 16 . 41 . the price has been cut in half since oct . 16 , when enron reported its third - quarter earnings . a $ 1 . 2 billion reduction in shareholder equity brought on by ending some relationships with partnerships that mr . fastow had headed was not disclosed in the earnings news release . mr . lay briefly mentioned it in the conference call that followed , but some analysts thought he was referring to a separate $ 1 billion write - off that was disclosed in the earnings document , and were angered when they later learned about it . on tuesday , when both mr . fastow and mr . lay discussed the company with analysts on the conference call , neither was willing to discuss details of the transactions between enron and the partnerships formerly controlled by mr . fastow . mr . lay cited the s . e . c . inquiry in declining to discuss the details of the transactions . the fact the transactions took place has been known for a year , but enron ' s disclosures have been widely criticized for being impossible to understand . by structuring the deals as involving forward commitments to deliver enron stock , it appears that enron was able to assure that losses on them would not lead to reported losses , but instead to reductions of shareholder equity that had no effect on the income statement . that is one of the issues the s . e . c . , whose inquiries were disclosed monday by the company , is expected to address . concerns have also grown this week over whether enron will face losses from complicated financing strategies that kept billions of dollars of debts off its balance sheet but left the company responsible for paying - - either in cash or with stock - - if things went wrong . on tuesday , mr . fastow assured investors that the company ' ' expects to continue to have sufficient liquidity to meet normal obligations , ' ' and said it had bank credit lines that were more than adequate . mr . fastow was viewed as one of the architects , with jeffrey k . skilling , the former enron chief executive who resigned in august , of the change in business strategy that turned enron from a gas - pipeline company into a an energy trading powerhouse that developed a large wall street following . its stock price peaked in the summer of 2000 at $ 90 . 75 . according to a person close to the company , while mr . mcmahon , mr . fastow ' s successor , was enron ' s treasurer , he told mr . skilling , who at the time was the chief operating officer , that he thought the partnerships involving mr . fastow presented a conflict of interest . after that discussion , mr . mcmahon moved to a different job at the company , this person said . shares of enron traded as low as $ 15 . 51 yesterday afternoon , the lowest price for the stock since early 1995 , before recovering . in after - hours trading , they fell to $ 16 . 14 . one of the factors that hurt the stock yesterday was a decision by m . carol coale , an analyst at prudential securities , to drop her rating to ' ' sell ' ' from ' ' hold . ' ' she had lowered the rating to ' ' hold ' ' from ' ' buy ' ' on monday . ' ' after the s . e . c . inquiry was announced , ' ' she said in an interview yesterday evening , ' ' enron should have addressed it by delivering a scapegoat , as a gesture to the street . now they are replacing him today . the timing is a little late , but i think it will be received positively by the street .

" in my continued discussions with the financial community , it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace andy as cfo , " enron chairman and ceo ken lay said in a statement after the stock market closed on a day investors continued dumping shares . enron , which had seen its stock battered this year for a variety of reasons , found itself high on wall street ' s hit list after it released third - quarter earnings on oct 16 . the earnings report drew renewed attention to something investors and analysts had already expressed displeasure at : fastow , with the approval of enron ' s board , had formed and run two investment partnerships - - ljm cayman and ljm 2 co - investment . the partnerships , which did complex financing and hedging deals with enron , served as a source of funding for enron projects and investments . but wall street questioned how fastow could watch out for the interests of enron ' s shareholders and the investment partnership at the same time . so fastow , in june , resigned his roles at the partnerships and enron also ended its relationships with the ljm entities . during the third - quarter , enron took a $ 35 million loss related to ending its ljm ties as well as a $ 1 . 2 billion reduction in shareholder equity . tuesday , lay told analysts and investors that procedures were rigorously followed to ensure the interests of enron and its shareholders were protected in dealings with the ljm partnerships . he said a " chinese wall " existed between enron and ljm . fastow ' s replacement , mcmahon , previously served as enron ' s treasurer before moving last year to another job with enron . most recently , he headed up the company ' s industrial markets group . a source close to enron said mcmahon asked to be reassigned from the treasurer ' s job because he was uncomfortable with the fastow - ljm setup . enron spokesman mark palmer said neither fastow nor mcmahon was available for comment wednesday . he also didn ' t know whether fastow is still receiving a salary . enron disclosed on monday that federal securities regulators had begun an " informal inquiry " into the ljm dealings . the news proved terrible for a company already working to rebuild investor confidence after a series of failed investments in telecommunications , water and retail power businesses and the surprise resignation of ceo jeff skilling in august for personal reasons . a continuously growing number of shareholder lawsuits against enron followed the earnings report and the news of the sec inquiry . wall street has stepped up its chronic complaints that enron ' s various financial dealings are too complex to follow and that the company fails to give analysts enough data to make proper evaluations . beyond the ljm partnerships , investors are concerned about two other partnerships enron set up . among the worries is that enron will end up having to issue new shares of stock to cover commitments associated with those entities . investors wouldn ' t like that because it would dilute the value of current outstanding shares . they are also afraid that enron ' s debt credit rating may be downgraded , which could have negative impacts on its overall business . in the last six days , enron ' s shares have closed lower and lower . on oct . 16 , the stock closed at $ 33 . 84 . on wednesday it closed at $ 16 . 41 , down $ 3 . 38 . wednesday , the hubbub surrounding enron also dragged down shares in other companies that engage in energy trading , including houston - based dynegy , which closed down $ 5 . 45 at $ 37 . 26 . there is concern enron ' s woes could in some way end up harming the energy trading markets . a conference call lay and senior executives , including fastow , held with analysts tuesday to help clear up questions didn ' t go as enron hoped . on wednesday , carol coale , an analyst with prudential securities in houston , moved from a " hold " to a " sell " rating . front page -

first section - enron replaces finance chief - energy company attempts to halt sharp decline in its share price . enron , the us energy group , yesterday replaced its embattled chief financial officer , andrew fastow , to try to halt a slide in its share price , which has lost about 40 per cent of its value this week . kenneth lay , enron ' s chief executive officer , said after the market closed that mr fastow was taking a leave of absence . the move came a day after mr lay defended mr fastow amid questions about his ties to controversial partnerships that had forced enron to take a $ 1 . 2 bn write - off . that loss , revealed last week , sparked the share sell - off amid concerns there may be more bad news to come . enron disclosed the loss during an october 16 conference call with analysts on its third - quarter results , saying the charge stemmed from closing funding mechanisms that enron had set up in the partnerships established with mr fastow . analysts say the charge has not been satisfactorily explained , leading to confusion among investors and an unofficial inquiry by the securities and exchange commission .

' ' on a recent conference call ` ` no one thought they did themselves any favor in terms of calming investors ' concerns . ' ' ` ` they were slightly hiding behind the fact that the sec has got this inquiry going . the fact that two days later andy is gone , and he was in the center , is a good sign that the company is realizing just how concerned investors are . ' ' ` ` there ' s always that worry once the sec gets involved that it could extend . you never know what could come of that . ' ' ` ` there is a bit of fear of the unknown about enron now , with the sec inquiry and the risk that there could be further asset write - downs . ' ' ` ` another thing they ' re criticized for is their lack of disclosure . we still haven ' t seen a balance sheet for the third quarter . ' ' ` ` people are saying , why don ' t you include a balance sheet with your results ? they promised better disclosure in the past and that was meant to begin in the third quarter . ' ' ` ` you ' d like to see just more information on asset write - downs and a discussion of their off - balance - sheet financing - - all these vehicles they have like marlin and osprey . ' ' ` ` we ' d like to see some clarity , answering those sort of questions . ' ' ` ` it seems as though enron at least are maybe at the start of a process where they ' re going to address and clean up their balance sheet and they ' ve started to replace management . ' ' ` ` investors have already had enough issues ' ' in corporate bonds recently and ` ` sometimes investors just think , ` not another nasty in my portfolio , ' and i ' d rather exit . ' ' ` ` for certain investors maybe they just get scared . i wanted to know more about it . people had speculated if it could go to junk . i don ' t think they could because i don ' t think enron could exist as a junk company . ' ' ` ` there ' s a certain reluctance ' ' to sell the bonds . ` ` you want to stand back for a moment and look at the fundamentals . ' ' ` ` when the spreads have already moved out that wide you have to reassess and see whether you think it ' s a buying opportunity .

" it could either be viewed as a positive step toward easing investor concern or it could be interpreted as if enron removed the cfo at the request of the sec , " prudential securities inc . analyst carol coale said wednesday . " who knows ? " enron officials hope it will result in increased investor confidence after the energy trading giant ' s stocks have declined in value each day since monday ' s announcement that the sec had inquired about partnerships that did business with enron while they were managed by fastow . " in my continued discussions with the financial community , it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace andy as cfo , " enron chief executive officer kenneth lay said after markets closed wednesday . fastow will take a leave of absence from the company while jeff mcmahon , who has served as chairman and chief executive of enron ' s industrial markets group , takes over his role . " i think change is good at this particular point in time , " said fac equities analyst robert christensen said . " i think andy was somewhat beleaguered . " a . g . edwards & sons analyst mike heim , however , said it will take more than replacing fastow as chief financial officer to clear the uncertainty looming in the financial world about enron and its partnerships . " i think the reason why the stock has been declining so sharply the last few days is due to a lack of clarity on the partnership arrangements , " heim said . replacing fastow alone won ' t clarify those arrangements , he added . " there is still uncertainty despite promises by management to be more transparent to the financial community , " heim said . " instead of being more transparent there is more confusion than ever . " enron ' s stock continued to plummet wednesday , closing down $ 3 . 38 to $ 16 . 41 per share , a 17 percent decline . since the wall street journal first reported on the partnerships last week , enron ' s stock price has slid nearly 52 percent . " the market was asking for that to happen , " j . p . morgan analyst anatol feygin said of fastow ' s departure . " this is really the first time enron has acted as an agent of the shareholder in this crisis . " previously , enron ' s managers have been " cautious and defensive in their approach , " he said . during a conference call tuesday to address investor concern , lay said the partnerships were fully disclosed and contained measures to ensure no conflict existed as fastow carried out the dual roles . the partnerships have since been dissolved . the call didn ' t work for many , including feygin and heim . " i didn ' t hear things like we ' ve unrolled all these partnership dealings or here ' s all the exact details of how the partnerships work or we don ' t ever expect to take any more charges , " heim said . " what i heard is we don ' t have to disclose that information until the 10 - q is filed . " the turbulent past few months which have included the sec inquiry , third quarter losses and the august resignation of the company ' s chief executive officer , jeff skilling , have left many analysts questioning the company ' s future , heim said . " it ' s really a speculative bet right now , but the odds favor the company being able to weather the storm and being a healthy company if not a year from now , two years from now , " he said . but much is going to depend on how much enron discloses to its investors , feygin said . feygin said mcmahon worked as enron ' s treasurer for two years under fastow before a disagreement over fastow ' s involvement in the partnerships caused mcmahon to leave his job as treasurer . " internally , jeff was always a proponent of andy not being involved in ( the partnerships ) , " feygin said . " three days ago i would have said there is no need for a change at the cfo level . today , it was pretty obvious it was something enron needed to do .

" investors were clearly not comfortable with exposure to andy , " said j . p . morgan analyst anatol feygin , who downgraded enron to " long - term buy " and owns no shares . fastow , 39 , ran ljm cayman and ljm 2 co - investment , two partnerships created by enron to buy company assets . enron ' s involvement in the financing vehicles cost the company $ 35 million in third - quarter losses . enron also bought back 62 million shares from ljm 2 at a cost of $ 1 . 2 billion to unwind its investment . during a conference call tuesday , lay said , " i and enron ' s board of directors continue to have the highest faith and confidence in andy and think he ' s doing an outstanding job as cfo .

2000 dow jones a press release says fastow is taking a leave of absence . he ' s been replaced by jeffrey mcmahon , formerly ceo of enron ' s industrial markets group . how might the enron bulls spin this ? likely , they will point to mcmahon ' s alleged opposition to fastow ' s role in the big hedging deal , called ljm 2 , to show that the " fastow era " is over . the wall street journal , citing anonymous sources , reported tuesday that as treasurer at enron mcmahon complained about fastow ' s possible conflict of interest . probably , the fear was that fastow couldn ' t serve enron and ljm 2 equally , especially as he was allegedly making a lot of money from ljm 2 . clearly , if mcmahon turns out to be a new broom , that ' s a positive for enron . an enron spokeswoman declined to comment on whether the journal ' s account of mcmahon ' s stance on ljm 2 was correct . not much else is encouraging , however . fastow ' s departure shows that it took massive drops in enron stock to force senior management into action . on a difficult conference call tuesday , ceo ken lay gave fastow resounding backing . it took wednesday ' s plunge to get lay to sign off on a new cfo . in other words , lay listens only when the market screams and hollers . how much further does the stock have to fall to bring further much - needed reforms at the company ? the spokeswoman responds that lay had discussions with analysts tuesday and wednesday that led him to the conclusion that fastow ' s replacement was necessary to rebuild investor confidence . enron culture is thick with financial sorcery . people got upset by one shadowy deal , but no one knows exactly how the company ' s core energy trading business makes money . it ' s hard to believe the ljm 2 deals were done in isolation and without the knowledge of the board . in fact , the chatter is that fastow and former ceo jeff skilling proposed the ljm 2 transactions to the board after it was reluctant to enter the broadband business . the board apparently feared the volatility that might come from being in broadband , so fastow allegedly proposed ljm 2 as a way to hedge that volatility away . this meant ljm 2 entered agreements that gave it access to increases in the value of broadband assets but protected enron from the downside . should the whole board be on the hook , too ? the spokeswoman responds that the board would not have entered the ljm 2 transaction if it had not thought it would benefit enron and its shareholders . lay has shown himself to be woefully out of touch with the market ' s views . arguably , that ' s downright reckless for a trading company that is dependent on potentially skittish short - term financing . letting things get this bad has risked good faith among enron counterparties and bankers . it shows an unhealthy reluctance to address key problems until they ' re unavoidable . the spokeswoman responds that the company is now working hard to improve transparency . any efforts in that direction will be much appreciated , but is it any wonder people compare this lot to long term capital management ?

" this company has been very much abused and maligned by people on wall street . they have some excellent businesses , and they have been carrying some losers .

" management used the sec inquiry as a shield to avoid elaboration on the issue at hand , the ljm transactions , " coale said in reference to the conference call . ? olson said it ' s unlikely that enron , with its coterie of lawyers , would allow the creation of illegal investment vehicles , but as to whether it was " right , " he conceded it was probably not . ? j . p . morgan ' s anatol feygin downgraded his rating to " long - term buy " from " buy , " saying an upgrade is precluded until the company provides more information about its liabilities . ?

" fiorina , who has claimed the top spot each year since fortune ' s inaugural list in 1998 , heads the biggest company ( $ 48 billion in revenues last year ) run by a woman . and she is still as audacious and impatient as ever . wall street practically heckled her latest move - a bold bet to buy compaq - but fiorina , 47 , remains defiant . in difficult times , " people who drive change are the subject of great scrutiny , " she says . as always , the list is a snapshot of power at a moment in time . last year , power resided in the technology and internet sectors , but that influence was fleeting . gone from the list this year : deborah " hurricane debby " hopkins , who pushed her agenda too ambitiously at lucent and lost her cfo job in may ; ellen hancock , who failed at her startup , exodus ; and morgan stanley ' s mary meeker , who influenced so many to buy into the internet fizz . but one web warrior looks better than ever : meg whitman , no . 2 on the list . she has never overpromised to investors ; instead she has diligently delivered above - target profits every single quarter . fourteen newcomers join the list this year : marce fuller , president louise kitchen , coo , enron americas ; colleen barrett , president betsy bernard , president & ceo , at anne stevens , vp , north america vehicle operations , ford motor ; maria elena lagomasino , chairman susan desmond - hellman , evp and chief medical officer , genentech ; janet robinson , svp , newspaper operations , new york times co . ; carol tomi , evp and cfo , home depot ; carrie cox , evp and president , global prescriptions , pharmacia ; carole black , president and ceo , lifetime television networks ; larree renda , evp , retail operations , safeway ; and louise francesconi , vp and gm , missile systems , raytheon . while the economy and its points of power change , the criteria we use to evaluate power remains the same . says sellers : " we consider the size and importance of a woman ' s business in the global economy , her clout inside her company , and the arc of her career - where she has been and where she is likely to go . when appropriate , we also weigh the woman ' s influence on mass culture and society . that factor lifts oprah winfrey to no . 3 on this year ' s list . " the shifts on our list this year are dramatic , with 14 newcomers . but one trend is especially intriguing : women are taking on bigger businesses than ever . a few years ago , responsibility for a $ 3 billion business almost automatically earned a woman a spot on this list . no more . this year ' s fortune 50 includes several women who lead businesses with annual revenues of $ 20 billion or more , which is a first . in a related story , " it took a lady to save avon , " katrina brooker looks at andrea jung , chairman and ceo of avon . says brooker , " jung knows what women want and how to sell it to them . and that ' s what has made her one of the most successful ceos - male or female - in recent years . " over the past 20 months she has overhauled nearly everything about the way avon does business : how it advertises , manufactures , packages , and even sells its products , and she has done it not by abandoning the seemingly outdated avon lady , but by reviving her . the result : growth in revenues , operating profits , and operating margins . in addition , fortune includes an international list of the 50 powerful women in business . the top ten , featured in the magazine , are marjorie scardino , ceo , pearson ( britain ) ; anne lauvergeon , chairman , areva ( france ) ; mary ma , senior vp marianne nivert , president lien siaou -

Subject: re : the consultant ' s model for gary hickerson ' s group the model is supposed to be a real option model to capture the value of power plants of gencos . it is to give trader a better insight as to whether the market is overvaluing / undervaluing certain genco stocks , and trader can act accordingly . i ' m still trying to find out how trader is supposed to use it . modeling details : the model takes in all gencos ' locational power forward prices and fuel forward prices , and uses garch model to simulate one year daily prices , and then uses a hourly profile to convert them into hourly prices . garch model parameters are estimated by the consultant using and separate model and are updated twice a year , and it does not matter whether the simulation starts in january or september . using these prices , it will determine whether a unit at a particular location will be dispatched or not depending on a ) spread of power and fuel prices , and b ) whether the start - up cost can be recovered during 8 operation hours . the unit can be dispatched at minimum and peak levels . fixed o & m , sox and nox ( i don ' t know what the last two stand for ) are taken into consideration . with the simulated dispatch schedule , the model calculates the value that can be generated by this unit , then sums it up across all units . the final value is the average of 100 simulations . and it takes about 16 hours to run for about 200 units . after our conversation , the consultant promised to look into a ) how to make the model more flexible , say , to allow a different time horizon , b ) reduce spreadsheet overhead by doing calculation one unit a time and not saving all the intermediate information ( as of now it saves everything on the spreadsheet ) . assuming the garch process is modelled correctly , i believe the methodology is ok , though it does not capture most of the optionality . my concerns are : whether the price processes are modelled correctly . i have to get more details before making any conclusion . 100 simulations are way too few . unless we convert the algorithm to c , i don ' t see how spreadsheet can handle more simulations . i guess that ' s why they contact us . but again , if enron ' s buying the model from the consulting company , why should enron do their job for them ? how trader ' s going to use the model output . for this i phoned jeff ( the associate who initiated all these ) and am still waiting for his returning call . a related questions why the model horizon is one year . we can either oversee the conversation , but not doing actual coding for them . or redo the model for them . ( the problem still remains that how trader ' s going to use the output ) . but in view of the great wall of china separating the business units , should we do it ? as of now i have a simulation model taking start - up cost , fixed o & m , rump - up delay into consideration . it simulates monthly prices ( using gbm ) and takes 2 minutes 40 seconds to run 10 , 000 simulations for one unit for ten years ( 120 time steps ) . it can use forward - forward vol and incorporate seasonality into it ( i understand this is debatable ) . ( one interesting observation is that when using forward - forward vol simulation , the standard deviation is about 0 . 5 % , while standard deviation using forward vol is about 2 % . also , incorporating seasonality increases the value by about 1 . 6 % ) . since most of the time - cost occurs in price simulation , and we are to simulate about 20 price processes , i hope the full model ( if we build it ) will take a couple of hours to run for 200 units . the main task will be interfacing , i . e . , getting data from data base , and outputting the results . this is where i need most help if i am to do it . please advice the course of action . i am supposed to talk to michelle cisneros today . p . s . i never promised to oversee a programmer in our group ( see the message below ) . best , alex - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - forwarded by alex huang / corp / enron on 01 / 05 / 2001 08 : 58 am - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - jeff m gray 01 / 04 / 2001 to : gary . hickerson @ enron . com , michael . w . bradley @ enron . com , michelle . d . cisneros @ enron . com , jaime . gualy @ enron . com cc : alex . huang @ enron . com , kskinner @ ftenergy . com , cseiple @ ftenergy . com subject : fw : project timeline ken and i worked up the following timeline and refined the trading methodology a bit this morning . we also met with alex huang from vince ' s group , and explained the model and coding tasks . ken and alex have arranged to speak by phone on monday , and meanwhile alex is coordinating within the research group . alex will oversee a programmer within his group , while interfacing regularly with us . 1 / 4 kickoff 1 / 11 complete spreadsheet , table , and database structures ( rdi ) . 1 / 17 complete software coding for the pricemaker component of the model ( rdi and enron research ) , and begin testing ( enron research ) . 1 / 22 complete software coding for the dispatch portion of the model ( rdi and enron research ) , and begin testing ( enron research ) . 1 / 22 complete financial trader " user " interface , within the access environment ( rdi ) . 1 / 22 complete collection and delivery of unverified generating - unit data from rdi databases ( rdi ) . begin verification process ( rdi ) . 1 / 29 complete all charts and reports accessible from the user interface ( rdi ) . 1 / 29 complete compilation of consensus ebitda forecasts for all operations other than merchant generation ( enron financial trading ) . 2 / 9 complete code testing ( enron research ) . 2 / 9 deliver verified and quality - checked generating - unit data ( rdi ) . 2 / 9 complete the model , begin testing the trading methodology , and train users . 2 / 16 finish training , testing , and final qc . jeff

( iv ) due diligence we continue the process with two new companies this week ( wednesday and thursday ) . andy zipper is taking the lead for the company arriving on wednesday , please help him with his requirements . i would ask that both john and i are notified of any changes to the netco personnel list on a timely fashion and that the list is maintained on a continual basis . please forward all alterations to jeanie slone who has responsibility for the master list . communication - i believe that the new year combined with a internal communication issues may be a good time to review what we want to say on netco and what our policies are . i am asking david oxley to co - ordinate with all of you on this . i know a lot of you believe that we need to only communicate once we have retention programme in place for the estate which may be a good idea but we we need to make sure that we lose as few people as possible . if you are unavailable this week , please ensure you delegate this work out . happy new year louise

Subject: stephen bennett vince , for your use as per our discussions - - - mike - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - forwarded by mike a roberts / hou / ect on 12 / 09 / 2000 10 : 32 am - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - from : mike a roberts 12 / 09 / 2000 10 : 33 am to : vince j kaminski / hou / ect @ ect cc : subject : stephen bennett stephen bennett , professional meteorologist , was hired into the research group in september of this year as a specialist based on salary alignment criteria . in retrospect , and upon review , he should have been hired on as a senior specialist . after coming on board . it rapidly became apparent that stephen was clearly an " under hire . " he is well - deserving of an immediate promotion ( really more of a correction ) and pay raise , to be made retroactive at least to the lst of this month . this memo outlines the circumstances surrounding this hiring error and provides detailed justifications for this retroactive " promotion . " at the time of the interview process , there was no position in enron designated as " professional meteorologist . " in fact , the most recent similar hire prior to that date was jose marquez , also a professional meteorologist , who was hired in , based on salary alignment criteria , as a manager . while functionally , both these men are meteorologists , enron has no such job classification . compounded by the urgency in bringing on additional professional expertise in short time order , it was difficult to peg the proper enron classification appropriate for this new position . this original uncertainty and resulting misplacement of stephen into the specialist category , rather than the senior specialist category , needs to be corrected at this time . although a " new - hire " to enron , stephen bennett has extensive work experience . he has worked as a professional meteorologist at both the weather services corporation in boston and at the weather channel in atlanta . he came to enron well - referenced by both those organizations , needing no further training and only minimal supervision . once aboard here in houston , stephen immediately demonstrated the core enron values with our unique sense of urgency . after only a week , he assumed responsibilities normally reserved for someone actually at even a manager level - he was assigned and fully took over the critical afternoon weather briefings to the gas traders . this includes analysis and report preparation as well as presentation . also in the presentation arena , he now regularly briefs various desks in the morning and throughout the day . stephen is a master of communication and particularly adept at conveying what through other messengers might otherwise seem confusing or ambiguous . stephen has also demonstrated an unusually high level of self - initiative . he designed , implemented , and now maintains several sub - sites on the research web page which he tailored to various customers - in specific : the weather derivatives team , the agricultural team , and most recently , the crude and liquids team . i have recently assigned stephen to spearhead our conversion and major upgrade of this web page . these above described accomplishments are above and beyond stephen  , s regular duties which include starting work at 5 am daily , reliably and without fail , to assemble and prepare our trader  , s weather report . recently , with the advent of extended hours for both nymex and enrononline , stephen voluntarily on his own accord , assists in our new sunday weather support effort . as his supervisor , fully cognizant of his already standard 50 + hour work week , i do not solicit , but readily accept , this above and beyond expectations assistance . in review , the circumstance which resulted in this under hire condition was enron  , s immediate need for a non - standard , fairly unique professional - a meteorologist , coupled with stephen  , s desire to work for our company in spite of the absence of a hierarchy which included the exact entitled professional title reflecting his chosen career path . . once hired , stephen has clearly demonstrated through contribution and performance that he is well - deserving of this immediate and retroactive promotion .

Subject: re : trading track information tom wilbeck @ enron 01 / 19 / 2001 03 : 23 pm to : jeffrey c gossett / hou / ect @ ect cc : subject : trading track information as you know , we are working on an on - boarding process to get the trading track participants up to speed as quickly as possible in each of their respective rotations . one of the methods of doing this is to have each rotational supervisor ( you ' re one of them ) put a few points together to present to each participant on the first day of their rotation with you ( or someone in your group ) . for example : what does you group do as a whole ? the risk management group is responsible for providing information to the trading floor . that information consists of positions , p & l , and other general information which may be needed by the floor throughout the day . the information must be 100 % accurate 100 % of the time as the gas floor is taking positions based on the information they are given . in addition , all reports go to sr . management such as john lavorato and dave delaney . the participants need to know several logistics type things such as : where to sit user tips on the use of related business hardware ( i . e . phone system , intercom , etc . ) how long / when or if to take lunch : use your discretion . expected working hours : expect to be in the office no later than 8 : 00 and preferably by 7 : 30 it is also important to cover the expected learning criteria with the participants on their first day : able to work under pressure - you will be asked to provide reports and answers to questions on the floor quickly . you will be expected to know and understand the information that you are giving . ability to handle multiple priorities - there will be times when you are faced with several tasks at once . you will be expected to make quick decisions and understand which is the most important . meets deadlines - everyday in risk you have to meet a deadline . the traders must have positions and p & l on their desks when they walk in in the morning . excellent written communication - your written communication will be in the numbers that you provide to the floor . excellent oral communication - again , the traders will expect answers and expect them quickly . you will need to articulate those in a fashion that is understandable . effective interpersonal skills - see above . attention to detail - this is one of the most important considerations of the job . again , all information must be 100 % accurate , errors are not acceptable . team player - you will be expected to work across all groups upstream and downstream to provide accurate information and solve related problems . excellent organisational skills - speed and accuracy are a hallmark of the job , therefore you will need to be organized at all times . is a motivated worker - self explainatory excellent analytical skills - same maintains relationships with traders - the trader will be relying on the information that you provide him . therefore it is important that he trusts what you are giving to him and that you are always asking if they need more or better information . effective time management - self explainatory competent in excel - alot of the work we do is in excel . it is important that you be able to navigate excel , as well as create efficiencies to make the job less prone to errors and to run more smoothly . competent with erms - erms is the system that is used to maintain positions and p & l . all deals flow through this system and all values related to deals come from this system . competent with risktrac - risktrac is the system that tracks counterparty risk and value at risk . i expect you to understand what each means , what the limits are , and how you can reduce and add to value at risk . demonstrates knowledge of trading concepts - work with the traders to understand why they are putting on the positions that they have . try to understand proper hedging strategies etc . each participant who comes to your area needs to know your interpretation of each of these competencies so they can make sure to meet your expectations while in your area . also , the participants need to fully understand exactly what they ' ll be doing in your area . let ' em know with as much detail as possible . finally , do you consider any information a pre - requisite for participation in your area ? ( i . e . advanced excel skills . . . etc ) i ' d like to know so we can push the participants to get the needed training before coming to your group . advanced excel skills , preferably a level of understanding of positions and value at risk . please compile this information and forward it to me so i can put it into some on - boarding material for all of the candidates by their first day of rotations . the first candidates will begin on february 1 , 2001 . thank you very much for you time and consideration . tom wilbeck x 57536
Subject: re : sharad update hi kate , firstly it was very useful to hold the informal discussion with him . sharad seemed hesitant due to the offer not being what he expected . he asked me some questions about the " bonus culture " at enron and suggested that it was not as good as at investment banks that he is interviewing with . i sold him on the value he can extract from the excellence within the research group and the ability to join a growing organisation at a critical point in , but he still seemed reticent saying that he " needs time " which i understood to mean that he was looking for a better offer elsewhere . he is a great candidate and it would be a real shame to lose him , given the difficulty of getting good candidates . i discussed this with vince and given how much we need him in research in london and vince agreed to discuss the possibility of an element of guarantee or sign on to help him make the right decision . i think vince will call you or dale to discuss this . regards , anjam tel : 713 345 9991 [ p . s . vince , kate bruges is on extension 37354 , dale is on 36726 ] kate bruges 13 / 07 / 2000 11 : 02 to : anjam ahmad / lon / ect @ ect cc : subject : sharad hi anjam how did your conversation go yesterday ? regards kate

Subject: cera monthly oil briefing - cera alert - december 20 , 2000 title : cera monthly oil briefing : fundamentals update e - mail category : cera monthly briefing cera knowledge area : world oil in the past two weeks , oil prices have sold off the premium or price strength that had been built into the market in anticipation of possible shortages this winter . the exact cause of the sharp switch in market psychology is hard to pinpoint but seems to be a combination of very early signs that the oil stock situation is at least stabilizing , even if stocks have not built substantially , and that , thus far , despite a few weeks of colder - than - normal temperatures , heating oil supply has been adequate to meet demand in the key us market . that has allayed some of the concerns that were driving speculative interest into the market . furthermore , the potential for weakness in the us economy may be creating expectations for weaker oil demand in 2001 . the change in market psychology was dramatically illustrated when news that iraq was cutting off exports caused prices to slide , yet , the iraqi export cutoff is having a concrete effect on fundamentals . if the cutoff lasts through december , the effect will be pronounced - it would turn a projected fourth quarter 2000 stockbuild of 0 . 5 million barrels per day ( mbd ) into a stockdraw of 0 . 1 mbd . we expect iraqi production levels to remain erratic because of its dispute with the un security council over sanctions , and exports may again cease . at some point such a development would have a price supportive effect . cera ' s price outlook for 2001 remains the same as that in the world oil watch released in late november . assuming normal winter weather and no prolonged or repeated shutdowns of iraqi production , the projected average for first quarter 2001 is $ 29 per barrel for wti . however , this outlook is based on opec ' s announcing an agreement early in the first quarter to cut its production by the start of the second quarter . a failure to restrain output would result in a downward adjustment to an average of $ 27 wti for the first quarter of 2001 , with prices lower in the second half of the quarter than in the first . the downward pressure results from the prospect of a larger - than - usual implied build in stocks during the second quarter of about 3 . 0 mbd - with a cut in opec output . iraq in a twilight zone as anticipated , iraq ceased exporting oil under the un - controlled " oil for food " program as of december 1 in protest over the rejection by the security council ' s sanctions committee of its proposed december export price schedule . * iraq ' s pricing was judged by the un overseers , who monitor the export program and advise the sanctions committee , to be about 60 cents per barrel below comparable crudes in an apparent attempt to offset an illicit surcharge that iraq was seeking from buyers . although the standoff with the sanctions committee continues , iraq partially resumed exporting on december 13 . since then , about 1 mbd has been exported from the mina al - bakr terminal in the persian gulf . prior to the shutdown , iraqi exports under un auspices were at a rate of 2 . 21 mbd for november , as compared with 2 . 08 mbd for the third quarter . exports for november were about 1 . 3 mbd from mina al - bakr and about 0 . 9 mbd from ceyhan in the mediterranean . exports from ceyhan have not resumed , owing to the surcharge dispute , with the result that about 1 . 2 mbd of iraqi crude remains off the market . iraq ' s semi - shutdown has put it into a kind of twilight zone while its dispute with the sanctions committee over pricing continues . ( in the midst of this dispute , the un security council approved phase nine of the oil - for - food program at the last minute on december 5 ; it became effective on december 6 and has been accepted by iraq ) . as of decemberl 9 , iraq ' s revised export price for ceyhan , proposed for the remainder of december , has again been judged too low by the overseers and is expected to be rejected by the sanctions committee . additionally , the overseers have notified lifters of iraqi crude that any oil payment made directly to iraq rather than to the un escrow account would be a violation of un sanctions . buyers of iraqi oil from mina al - bakr have consistently been reported as saying that they are not paying a surcharge to iraq . how long iraq may operate at about half capacity is unclear , but it continues to request a surcharge payment from prospective lifters at ceyhan in an apparent effort to circumvent and degrade the un financial controls that are the heart of the sanctions system . the distinction that iraq has made between mina al - bakr and ceyhan arose when it resumed operations at mina al - bakr by loading two cargoes for the india oil company . iraq may have judged this accommodation to be in its interest , since it recently also signed an oil exploration contract with india under which payments would be made in oil . as currently structured , the deal would violate un sanctions , but india is seeking an exception from the security council on grounds of economic hardship . the exception seems unlikely to be granted , which may lead iraq to cease exports from mina al - bakr again . there are many possible scenarios that iraq could follow , but we expect uncertainty about iraqi exports to continue as iraq uses its oil exports as leverage to undermine sanctions in its ongoing struggle with the security council to end all restraints . consequently , the iraq factor will remain an element in the oil price outlook . iraq ' s antisanctions campaign has also raised the visibility of the iraq issue in washington as the incoming bush administration prepares to take office . secretary of state - designate colin powell has already acknowledged a need to reassess iraq policy and has said that he would work to " reenergize " sanctions . the iraq issue is being debated in virtually every foreign policy - oriented think tank in washington . a consensus seems to be emerging around seeking renewed international support and legitimacy for sanctions by retaining un control over iraq ' s oil revenue and strictly enforcing a prohibition on sales of weapons and related material while lifting general trade controls that increasingly are both ineffective and an international irritant . there is virtually no sentiment in favor of operations to destabilize or remove the saddam hussein regime on the pragmatic basis that the prospects for success are remote . demand trends record high us natural gas prices have increased the economic incentive for gas consumers with the capability to switch from gas to distillate to do so , and reports of switching are emerging in a number of areas . interruptible gas customers with resid or distillate fuel back - up have already switched to oil , so it is now firm gas supply customers with the potential to add to the already high level of distillate demand . so far in december us distillate demand is running at a record high december level of 3 . 9 mbd . however , only a small portion of this demand is the result of economically based fuel - switching from gas to distillate . cera estimates that the additional demand likely to come from further switching of gas to distillate is relatively small , on the order of 0 . 1 to 0 . 2 mbd . in cera ' s view it is likely that only a portion of the theoretical capacity will be switched on short notice because in some cases , this theoretically switchable capacity has not been used in recent years , and tankage and delivery infrastructure may be in uncertain condition . switching by interruptible gas customers ( such as utilities ) to distillate began about a month or more ago , although the volumes involved are relatively small . switching to residual fuel already occurred months ago when gas prices started to surge in the summer . a portion of the us secondary and tertiary distillate stockbuild seen this autumn was likely prompted by interruptible gas customers filling their reserve distillate fuel storage . given the expectations of a tight gas market , regulators have been explicit about enforcing back - up fuel storage requirements in the months leading up to the current heating season . other end users of natural gas have few or no options for fuel switching . some ammonia and ethane producers have shut down operations because the cost of feedstock natural gas is high . natural gas is also used in some enhanced oil recovery operations , and some of these producers have also opted to sell gas back to the grid rather than produce oil . supply trends non - opec supply for the fourth quarter is expected to be up 0 . 9 mbd over a year earlier at 46 . 4 mbd . recent events include a shortfall in mexican production , curtailed in october by about 300 , 000 bd owing to the effects of hurricane keith . mexico ' s fourth quarter liquids production is expected to be 3 . 64 mbd - about 95 percent of mexican liquids capacity . norway ' s output increased 200 , 000 bd from october to november as maintenance season ended . norway ' s production for the fourth quarter is expected to be 3 . 53 mbd . * growing russian crude oil production throughout the year is supporting a recent surge in exports , in spite of higher export taxes . russian exports of domestic oil production ( excluding transit volumes ) reached 2 . 5 mbd in november , after remaining fairly steady at about 2 . 35 mbd from july though october . fourth quarter oil exports are expected to average 2 . 5 mbd , 0 . 3 mbd greater than in the fourth quarter 1999 . cera estimates iraqi oil production averaged 2 . 91 mbd in november - down 0 . 1 mbd from the october level . the cutoff in exports earlier this month reduced iraqi output for the first 12 days of december to roughly 0 . 8 mbd . iraq resumed exports of about 1 mbd on december 13 , which raised production to 1 . 80 mbd . assuming no change in iraq ' s current production stance , iraqi production would average 1 . 41 mbd for december . on a quarterly basis , the decline in iraq output would lead to estimated opec output in the fourth quarter of 29 . 0 mbd and would turn an estimated global oil stockbuild of 0 . 5 mbd into a stockdraw of 0 . 1 mbd . these production estimates include 0 . 15 mbd of crude oil exports to syria that began on november 20 without un authorization and are continuing . oil stocks us crude oil inventories ( doe data ) have climbed intermittently from an annual low of 280 million barrels in september and reached 292 million barrels in mid - december ( see figure 1 ) . since prices weakened in late november , crude oil stocks have stabilized above the annual low in september and the ranges seen in october to levels from 289 - 292 million barrels . primary inventories of us heating oil remain well below year - earlier levels ; at 48 million barrels they are 15 million barrels , or 24 percent less , than those of a year ago , but there are indications of builds in secondary and tertiary inventories . we estimate that wholesale and consumer stocks are up 5 - 10 million barrels since august and are actually higher than they were at the end of last year . in europe crude oil stocks are at more comfortable levels when compared with those of the united states . in november stocks rose nearly 9 million barrels to 426 million barrels . at this level they are below the highs of 1999 but well above the low levels of early 1996 ( see figure 2 ) . japanese crude oil inventories at end - october were 107 . 6 million barrels , which is above the record low set earlier this year but still well below levels seen in recent years ( see figure 3 ) . come shoot the rapids with us at ceraweek 2001 , " shooting the rapids : strategies and risks for the energy future " in houston , february 12 -

Subject: electric developments i consulted with kevin before i took the oars in trying to answer your question , as well as the questions raised in drew ' s e - mail . here ' s what we found out . . . steve ' s question : what economics would determine if a developer could site a power plant in new mexico ( maybe 3 , 000 mw ) and build a line to the grid in california versus us expanding to deliver the gas to a power plant in california ? what you ' re really asking here is " what are the comparative economics of energy delivered by wire versus energy delivered by pipeline ? " in this analysis , there are a few considerations - - ( 1 ) original capital cost to construct facilities , ( 2 ) the operating cost of the facilities , including energy loss , and ( 3 ) environmental and other permitting considerations . engineers tell us that , as a rule of thumb , high voltage transmission lines and tower facilities cost approximately $ 800 , 000 to $ 1 mm / mile to construct turnkey . this figure is comparable to the $ 1 mm / mile " rule of thumb " we use for turnkey construction of mainline diameter ( 30 - 36 " ) high - pressure steel pipeline . in terms of operating costs , for anything over 100 miles in length , there are three ( 3 ) basic sources of energy loss in electric transmission : ( 1 ) transformation loss , ( 2 ) radiation loss ( efm ) and ( 3 ) heat loss across the conductors . a rule of thumb for electric transmission loss is 3 % . this number is comparable to the actual fuel used for compression on transwestern ' s pipeline . the most critical issue impacting construction of high voltage transmission lines is in the area of permitting . there just aren ' t many new transmission lines being approved . it was suggested by more than one source that an electric transmission project on the order posited in your example , could take anywhere from 6 to 10 years to secure authorization . the issues of electromagnetic field ( emf ) radiation around high voltage power lines , along with other wildlife endangerment concerns , are significant obstacles in securing permits for right - of - way . in short , the answer is that while the economics on face appear to be comparable for construction and operation of both natural gas pipelines and electric transmission lines , the protracted permitting process for electric transmission lines tips the scale considerably towards the more immediate returns available on investment in natural gas pipeline infrastructure . drew ' s questions : 1 . what are the key factors that determine where a power plant developer puts his plant ? for purposes of this exercise , i ' m assuming we ' re talking gas - fired generation . developers generally describe four considerations in deciding where to site a new electric power plant : 1 . market area demand ( distributive ) and / or transmission access to market 2 . water rights for turbine cooling 3 . ease of permitting ( environmental , encroachment , fed / state / local regulations , affected agencies / jurisdiction ) 4 . proximity to natural gas pipeline / supply infrastructure 2 . do the transmission access and pricing rules of the various utilities / power pools vary all that much or are order 888 tariffs pretty much the same all over ? ferc order 888 and 889 require public utilities to commit to standards of conduct and to file open access tariffs affecting transmission among and between other utilities and / or power pools in the various operating regions . ferc ordered public utility transmission owners to provide transmission access and comparable service to competitors and to functionally separate their transmission / reliability functions from their wholesale merchant functions . the rulemaking is analogous to the open access requirements under ferc order 436 / 500 / 636 affecting interstate natural gas pipelines . it ' s pretty obvious from the california example this past summer , that with respect to the overall operation of a deregulated power market in individual states , particularly as concerns the establishment and regulation of independent system operators ( iso ' s ) , there is substantial room for improvement ( and possible further ferc involvement ) . " in the open access final rule ( order no . 888 ) , the commission issues a single pro forma tariff describing the minimum terms and conditions of service to bring about this nondiscriminatory open access transmission service . all public utilities that own , control , or operate interstate transmission facilities are required to offer service to others under the pro forma tariff . they must also use the pro forma tariffs for their own wholesale energy sales and purchases . order no . 888 also provides for the full recovery of stranded costs - - that is , costs that were prudently incurred to serve power customers and that could go unrecovered if these customers use open access to move to another supplier . " 3 . how do ipp ' s decide what fuel supply strategy works best ( i . e . , buy bundled delivered fuel from someone vs . buy gas , storage , transport , etc . separately ) ? in my experience , there is no " one size fits all " formula or strategy . for example , in the past we ' ve seen calpine take a very hands - on approach to supplying its ipp projects . in the mid to late ' 80 ' s , during the build out of several qf ' s ( cogens ) , calpine bought natural gas reserves in the ground and dedicated them to the project . in today ' s market , calpine has scavenged the gas and basis traders from statoil and set - up a natural gas desk for the purchase and transportation management of gas supplies needed for its western u . s . power projects . in other projects , developer / owners and their lenders are satisfied with a less active role in securing gas supply / transportation to the project . in short , projects look at the liquidity of the gas supply / transportation market in deciding whether they can achieve project economics and secure reliable supply by taking bids or rfp ' s for gas supply / transportation , or whether to take a more hands - on approach ala calpine . 4 . what is the rto rule and why should we care ? last december , the ferc issued order no . 2000 , a final rule on regional transmission organizations ( rto ' s ) . order 2000 builds on the foundation of orders 888 and 889 ( issued in 1996 ) . according to ferc chairman jim hoecker , order 2000 makes " a persuasive case for separating control of grid operations from the influence of electricity market participants . " therefore , order 2000 can be seen as a natural outgrowth of the perceived limitations on the functional unbundling adopted in orders 888 and 889 , continuing balkanization of the electric transmission grid based on corporate , not state or regional boundaries , as well as pressure to provide guidance on acceptable forms of privately - owned transmission companies . ferc prescribes a voluntary approach to rto participation . the order initiates a regional collaborative process to foster rto formation . the order also imposes filing requirements on the privately owned " public utilities " that are subject to ferc jurisdiction , and requires these private utilities to describe in their filings how they have attempted to accommodate the needs of transmission owning state / municipal , cooperative and federally owned systems . ferc believes that , regardless of format , rto ' s will offer the following benefits : ( 1 ) alleviate stress on the bulk power system caused by structural changes in the industry , ( 2 ) improve efficiencies in transmission grid management through better pricing and congestion management , ( 3 ) improve grid reliability , ( 4 ) remove remaining opportunities for discriminatory practices , ( 5 ) improve market performance , ( 6 ) increase coordination among state regulatory agencies , ( 7 ) cut transaction costs , ( 8 ) facilitate the success of state retail access programs , and ( 9 ) facilitate lighter - handed regulation . critics point out that with its emphasis on flexibility , voluntary rto formation and transmission rate reforms ( i . e . , incentives ) , order 2000 defers for case - specific disposition many of the tough issues that must be resolved in order to create an operational rto . moreover , order 2000 does not compel any transmission owner to join an rto , but provides only regulatory guidance and incentives for willing participants , as well as a veiled threat of further consequences for the hold - outs . as to the final part of the question ( " why should we care ? " ) , presumably , the development of a fully - functioning rto network will promote both the efficiency and market transparency goals of the original ferc orders . as ferc reads it , the future of gas - fired generation for both merchant and utility systems , depends on an efficiently operated open access transmission system . therefore , the promise of the rto is to stimulate competition and the ongoing investment in new generation infrastructure . unfortunately , sources tell me that the voluntary nature of the rto program may ultimately cripple its effectiveness in meeting its stated goals . 5 . has $ 5 / mmbtu gas killed the gas fired power market ? natural gas prices of $ 5 / mmbtu can only " kill " gas - fired power plants in those instances where ( 1 ) there are more economical alternatives to natural gas fuel , ( 2 ) demand for electric power is offset through demand side management or ( 3 ) natural gas in an environment of short supply is expressly prohibited from use as a power plant fuel . in the western u . s . marketplace , particularly in california , i see no viable alternative to natural gas fuel for electric power generation . renewable resources currently meet less than 5 % of the total electric resource requirements . $ 32 / barrel oil prices give fuel oil no clear economic advantage over natural gas ( even at a $ 5 / mmbtu price ) . moreover , california environmental and permitting regulations make the installation of new electric generation based on anything other than natural gas fuel or renewable resources virtually impossible . while demand side management programs are the politically correct approach to meeting resource needs , historically , they have served only a minor role in offsetting the growth in electric power . as to the final point , i ' m unable to comment on the risk of future legal / regulatory restrictions governing the use of natural gas as a boiler or turbine fuel . steven harris 10 / 26 / 2000 10 : 05 am to : kevin hyatt / et & s / enron @ enron cc : jeffery fawcett / et & s / enron @ enron subject : re : electric developments since you are the " expert " in this area , i need to know what economics would determine if a developer could site a power plant in new mexico ( maybe 3 , 000 mw ) and build a line to the grid in california versus us expanding to deliver the gas to a power plant in california . if you could let me know by next friday i would appreciate it . kevin hyatt 10 / 25 / 2000 04 : 32 pm to : sharrisl @ enron . com cc : subject : electric developments steve , see below . drew asked me to help him out with his meeting . kh - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - forwarded by kevin hyatt / et & s / enron on 10 / 25 / 2000 04 : 34 pm - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - enron energy services from : drew fossum 10 / 25 / 2000 01 : 49 pm to : dari dornan / et & s / enron @ enron , lee huber / et & s / enron @ enron , tony pryor / et & s / enron @ enron , maria pavlou / et & s / enron @ enron , susan scott / et & s / enron @ enron , jim talcott / et & s / enron @ enron , kathy ringblom / et & s / enron @ enron cc : michael moran / et & s / enron @ enron , kim wilkie / et & s / enron @ enron , kevin hyatt / et & s / enron @ enron , john dushinske / et & s / enron @ enron , shelley corman / et & s / enron @ enron subject : electric developments when we originally decided to use my staff meetings for " graduate education " one of the hot topics was the electric industry . we all had a first lesson on this topic in shelley ' s electricity seminar last summer . now , john and kevin have graciously agreed to join us tuesday at 1 : 30 to discuss recent developments in electric markets and nn ' s and tw ' s efforts to attract power generation load to the system . specific topics i hope to cover include the following : 1 . what are the key factors that determine where a power plant developer puts his plant ? 2 . do the transmission access and pricing rules of the various utilities / power pools vary all that much or are order 888 tariffs pretty much the same all over ? 3 . how do ipps decide what fuel supply strategy works best ( i . e . , buy bundled delivered fuel from someone vs . buy gas , storage , transport , etc . separately ) ? 4 . what is the rto rule and why should we care ? 5 . has $ 5 / mmbtu gas killed the gas fired power market ? depending on how deeply we get into these topics , we may need to schedule a follow - up session at a later date . i look forward to seeing you on tuesday . df

Subject: california update 3 / 21 / 01 executive summary : ? situation " confused " but filing probably postponed until monday ? could be sooner if negotiations completely collapse , or if commercial paper holders file pre - emptively to the qfs ? qfs pressuring legislature for rate hikes , in - state generators negotiating with ferc ? davis ' s proposed cpuc payment to qfs would require legislative approval - - tough to get before friday ? absent rate hikes , bankruptcy filing against edison is still best option for qfs - doubts about gas supply contracts and market value of davis ' price proposals 1 . situation confused , but bankruptcy unlikely before monday the situation in california is described as " confused " due to the flurry of activity by the governor over the last twenty - four hours . it seems likely that this state of confusion will serve to forestall an involuntary bankruptcy filing until next week , when the situation should become clearer . 2 . earlier bankruptcy possible if . . . . sources believe that two events could change this and precipitate an " immediate " filing : 1 ) a breakdown in negotiations between the governor and the qfs and 2 ) a puc order to pay the qfs $ 1 billion , which would be seen as a preference payment and cause the commercial paper holders to file an involuntary bankruptcy . 3 . qfs negotiating with davis , in - state generators talking to ferc sources report that the qfs are currently either meeting with their lawyers are involved in negotiations with the governor ' s people and the legislature . they are reportedly " working on keeley , " since he has actually suggested openly that there needs to be a rate increase . sources report that the in - state merchant generators are occupied today with preparing reports for the ferc . the ferc has made demands that the generators report to them on market conditions , etc . that have governed their reactions . the reports are due tomorrow . sources indicate that ferc has placed these demands to placate the california delegation and to " give the appearance of concern " for the situation in california . note , however , that the ferc did not make similar demands on out - of - state generators . 4 . $ 1 billion payment to qfs requires legislative approval , could trigger filing by commercial paper holders sources report that the governor continues to focus on trying to get a $ 1 billion payment made to the qfs to forestall a bankruptcy filing . he is trying to get the legislature to grant the puc the authority to order this payment . this is in spite of the fact that such a payment would be seen by commercial paper holders as a preference payment , and that the money might have to be returned in the event of a bankruptcy filing . such an order by the puc would likely precipitate an involuntary bankruptcy filing by the commercial paper holders . 5 . why is involuntary bankruptcy still attractive for the qfs ? davis / capuc plan does not incorporate payments on existing debt and requires a less than " market standard " price concession from the qfs ( $ 75 mw 5 yrs , $ 69 mw for ten years ) . current spot market power prices in the west far exceed these values . qfs who are already off - line have no need to worry about " pre - payments " or future payments for power ; they just want payment for the power they have provided . the key weakness in this proposed plan is the inability of the qfs to fix their costs going forward . their biggest cost is natural gas . the natural gas supply contracts are between the utilities and gas providers . it would be up to the utilities to fulfill the terms of the contracts . it does not appear reasonable that a natural gas supplier would enter into a 5 - or 10 - year gas supply contract with pg & e or socal , since in the even of a bankruptcy these contracts could be rejected . the utilities remain a credit risk . unless the price of natural gas is fixed , the qfs cannot enter into 5 - or 10 - year power contracts at these prices . moreover , gas price volatility is expected to increase rather than decrease . some sort of state support is needed to fix the gas supply contracts , and there has been no indication that the state is willing to make this sort of commitment . the state legislature does not seem willing to assume more risk at this point .
Subject: erc financing joe and louise : i was on a conf call today re erc financing . legal and finance were on the call . the consensus was that it would be difficult . the structure involves selling the erc ' s at market to an entity controlled by the bank ; buying a call from that entity ; selling a put to that entity ; having a price swap ( fixed / floating ) with entity . the bank would also want to understand market liquidity , price transparency and the rules of every district we have erc ' s in . the texas sox deal recently put into this vehicle was much simpler in a more liquid market , but it took 4 months and $ 1 mm of legal fees to put together . the lawyers involved believe that it would be more difficult and likely more expensive for the california erc ' s - we have several districts and several products . $ 1 mm + internal resources seems like a lot for a $ 20 mm - $ 30 mm balance with an expected term of one year - especially with uncertain success due to the price transparency issues ( no index price ) . any thoughts ? chris calger 503 - 464 - 3735

Subject: california power 1 / 19 / 00 1 . legislation passes - short - term measures , very long - term measures as we said yesterday , sb - 7 x passed the california state senate easily . the bill gives the state the immediate authority to purchase power via the department of water and resources until february 2 nd . the department will have $ 400 million available to finance power purchases , but there expectations that these costs could easily rise to $ 1 billion by next week . ab - 1 x has evolved into a longer - term solution and in its current form , would authorize the department of water and resources to enter into long - term contracts ( as opposed to the 15 day contracts in sb - 7 x ) to buy power at a price cap of 5 . 5 cents per kw / h . this legislation is not expected to pass today and will likely be changed considerably during the upcoming two week period covered by sb - 7 x , when negotiations between generators , the utilities , and the state are likely to resume . a second piece of legislation under - - sb 6 x - - has created uncertainty in the markets . this legislation will create a california public power authority with bond issuance authority . the uncertainty concerns whether the new authority will address the problem of the $ 12 billion in outstanding debt owed by the utilities . the current text of the legislation focuses only on longer term measures such as expanding generation capacity and improving efficiency . yet the legislation also says " the authority may issue bonds , exercise power of eminent domain , and enter into joint power agreements and buy , own , and sell land and facilities necessary for the financing of a project . " the general nature of this language leaves open the possibility of either issuing bonds to finance past debts , or using eminent domain or the bond authority to finance the utilities as they enter into a ch . 11 proceeding . 2 . default update 3 . bush as we reported on wednesday , the bush administration continues to demonstrate little interest in getting involved

Subject: california update 5 / 14 / 01 ? over the weekend , gov . davis and senate polance made an informal agreement whereby senate polance has agreed to sponsor the socal mou bill . polanco is a democrat and is currently suffering through a personal scandal and as a result , it is reported that his political career is essential dead . polance is planning to run for mayor of los angeles rather than run for another senate term . ? the bill is expected to be introduced in the new extraordinary session , beginning today or tomorrow . the bill would first go to the senate energy committee . sen . bowen , the chair of the committee , strongly opposes the mou , so the bill is expected to remain in committee hearings for some time . the longer the bill is involved in committee politics and changes are made , the likelihood of a socal bankruptcy increases .

" simply stated , we have two problems : supply is too low and costs are too high . both result from the flawed deregulation scheme created in 1996 . but no matter how we got into this mess , you hired me to solve problems . and that ' s what i ' m doing . " the only long - term solution is to build more power plants . we must also cut back on consumption and stabilize the utilities . but prices won ' t fall and supply won ' t be truly reliable until we generate more power than we consume . " yet in the 12 years before i took office , not a single major power plant was built in california . not one . since i became governor , we ' ve licensed 12 major power plants . ten more are in the pipeline . and we ' re doing this without weakening our commitment to clean air and clean water . " deregulation required the utilities to sell off many of their power plants to independent generating companies . the generators are free to charge whatever they want because they ' re governed only by federal regulators who refuse to control wholesale energy prices . " this past winter , the prices charged by the generators shot through the roof , driving the utilities to the brink of bankruptcy . " in january , with the feds still refusing to do their job , california stepped in to purchase the power the utilities could no longer afford to buy . we didn ' t take over to save the utilities . we took over to keep the power on and the economy strong . that ' s not all : - - we also negotiated long - term contracts for electricity at vastly lower prices . - - i used my emergency powers to seize control of low - cost power contracts the utilities were about to forfeit to the generators . - - we began negotiations to buy the utilities ' transmission system . - - we cut red tape and offered cash incentives to speed up construction of power plants . - - we ' re launching an $ 800 million conservation program . - - we ' re moving to establish a public power authority to build more power . if the private sector fails to build all the plants california needs , we ' ll build them ourselves . - - and because i share your concern that the generators are ripping us off , we ' re using every legal remedy to root out and punish illegal conduct . " we can ' t fix 12 years of inaction overnight . but we ' re making real progress . " now , as you know , i have fought tooth and nail against raising rates . it ' s become increasingly clear , however , that with rising natural gas prices , the feds ' failure to control costs , and the state ' s lack of supply , that some rate increases are needed to keep our lights on and our economy strong . " but i remain committed to protecting average californians from massive rate hikes . so i ' m urging the public utilities commission to adopt a plan that will protect average consumers , reward those who conserve and motivate the biggest users to cut back . " under my proposal , more than half of you won ' t pay a penny more . for the rest , the average increase will be 26 1 / 2 percent . for many of that group , rates will rise only about 10 percent . the heaviest users will see their rates rise 34 1 / 2 percent on average . that includes business paying their share . this is in addition to the 9 percent surcharge we ' ve all been paying since last winter . " but all californians can reduce their bills through conservation . " here ' s the point : the more you use , the more you pay . the more you conserve , the more you save . conservation is our best short - term weapon against blackouts and price - gouging . by flexing your power , you ' ll help secure our energy future . " unlike the puc , my plan includes funds to restore the utilities to financial stability - - if they agree to three main conditions : " they must provide low - cost regulated power to the state for 10 years . agree to sell us their transmission system . and dismiss their lawsuits seeking to double your electricity rates . " my proposal raises rates fairly , assures us of long - term power , stabilizes the utilities and promotes conservation . " our emphasis on conservation is critical . in order to make it through the summer , we must cut demand by at least 10 percent . " already we ' ve launched programs to cut back commercial lighting , and reduce consumption in office buildings , schools and government facilities . " friends , we have a power shortage but we are far from powerless . we are 34 million strong and if each of us does our part , we can minimize disruptions and get through the summer . we are californians . we ' ve withstood earthquakes , floods , fires , and droughts . " yes , this mess is man - made , but with your help and god ' s blessing , we ' ll get through this as well . " thank you and good night . " copyright 2001 ap

Subject: class speaker vincent , we met last year when you were visiting the university , and talking primarily with our finance faculty . as you may have heard , i tried to call to talk with you about the possiblity of a guest speaker in my class on real options from your group at enron . naturally , i would be delighted if you could speak , but i could also appreciate the possibility that someone else might also be a good choice . i have attached a copy of the course syllabus for your information . this is the first time this course has been offered at ut , and i was motivated to do so because of the " buzz " regarding the topic in industry . i have about 30 mba students in the class , many of whom were in the energy finance classes offered by sheridan titman and ehud ronn ( both of whom have been very supportive of the development of this class ) . my own background is decision analysis rather than finance , so i tend to approach the topic with that perspective . as you can see , i have covered both traditional decison analysis topics and a review of the options literature . at the present time , i don ' t think there is a really complete textbook that fits the course at the mba level , so i ' ve tried to focus on how to do things in practice , and have provided software ( dpl , spreadsheets , @ risk , etc ) as tools for the students to use . the course is scheduled on thursday afternoons from 3 : 30 to 6 : 30 , which is a time that i chose to make possible the participation of some executive mba students from houston ( 3 are participating ) . i look forward to hearing from you about the possiblity of a speaker , or any other suggestions that you might have . james s . dyer fondren centennial chair in business department of management science and information systems cba 5 . 202 the university of texas at austin austin , texas 78712 - 1175 email : j . dyer @ bus . utexas . edu telephone : 512 - 471 - 5278 fax : 512 - 471 - 0587

Subject: enron and the new economy value research lab gentlemen : enron is exploring the possibility of becoming involved in a research endeavor called the new economy value research lab . the lab is the result of a joint effort between mit ' s sloan school of management and arthur andersen ( aa ) . its purpose is to develop " quantitative valuations of the intangible assets wall street finds increasingly important in the new economy " ( business week , 2 / 7 / 00 ) . clearly , as enron continues to shift from a hard asset to intangible asset based organization , the question of " how to " accurately and appropriate measure and value our intangible assets is becoming increasingly important . last week , steve kean , vince kaminski , marie hejka , and myself met with a team from aa , the deputy dean of the sloan school , and mit ' s lead accounting / finance professor to discuss the intent of the lab , expected outcomes , and how enron may be involved . post that meeting , the decision was made to continue to explore participation in the lab . enron now needs to 1 ) define our corporate measurement and valuation process needs , and 2 ) identify value attributes important to enron and the industries in which we operate . once defined , a follow up meeting will be held with mit and next steps will be determined . your expertise and assistance could significantly impact the inputs and outcomes of these next steps . please schedule time on tuesday august 1 from 2 : 00 to 3 : 30 to attend the next meeting , during which we will begin to identify needs and define value attributes . location will be eb 49 c 4 . please notify me if you are unable to attend . lastly , to assist with preparation for this meeting , i am attaching notes from a recently published book entitled cracking the value code : how businesses are creating wealth in the new economy ( may 2000 , boulton , libert , samek - arthur andersen ) . should you like more information on the lab , previous meeting , book or other , please feel free to contact me . i look forward to meeting you . regards , amy oberg

the dissertation hasn ' t been reviewed by les or the external yet - although its been at forc for 2 months . i think that the empirical chapter is probably the one which would be of most relevance to both our company ' s businesses - although i ultimately didn ' t have the time to ' explicitly ' price the jump risk - premium which i conjectured is possibly implicit in the prices of exchange - traded electricity futures - options - rather i developed an implicit estimation procedure which will enable a rough assessment ( with a little bit of further work , but not too much ) be made of the price of jump risk in wholesale power markets . in other words , i assumed spot jump - risk to be undiversifiable , and essentially devoted 2 theoretical chapters to : 1 ) proving that a jump - diffusion trading model is " incomplete " ( synthesising the securities markets framework with martingale representation theory ) - note that i did not assume that markets could be dynamically completed with ' term structure ' securities as in the hjm w / jumps papers of shirakawa and das and ; 2 ) deriving an explicit risk - adjustment process for ' implementing ' the price of jump - risk using a jump - diffusion marginal indirect utility of wealth process ( ie . a jump - augmented production economy approach in the spirit of cir , bates , ahn whereas in the latter the driftless forward supposition means that i have to capture mean - reversion via the futures volatility function , and jumps are less easy to calibrate . any suggestions ?

Subject: juvenile diabetes foundation fundraising it is my sincere honor to once again lead the enron team in this year ' s juvenile diabetes foundation ( jdf ) walk scheduled to take place on sunday , november 5 , 2000 , at the sam houston race park . i continue to serve on the board of jdf representing enron and will be enron ' s corporate executive for this year ' s fundraising efforts . as many of you may already know , i am an insulin dependent diabetic myself . even though i know how difficult this disease can be to manage with the multiple finger pricks for blood samples and several shots each day , i cannot imagine how difficult it is for a small child with this disease . taking insulin does not cure the disease nor prevent the development of complications ; insulin is simply their life support system and without it they would die . enron continues to be a major corporate sponsor for jdf again this year . jdf is a very efficient organization in which approximately 84 % of all money raised goes directly to research . enron ' s goal this year is to raise $ 225 , 000 and we need your help . enron has been the number 1 walk team for 5 years in a row and we are not ready to give up first place ! we need team leaders , walkers and volunteers to help us reach our goal . the theme for the walk this year is " knock out diabetes " and we would like to have you join us for this great event . the walk is truly a blast and we had about 500 enron people participate last year and everyone enjoyed it . if you are interested in volunteering to be a walker or a team leader , or if you would like to make a pledge , you may call any of the steering committee members listed below . if you are interested in being a team leader , please contact one of the following people immediately so that you may be included in the first important and informative training session taking place this week . thank you very much for your support . mike mcconnell steering committee members : blanca bollom x 66091 rachel feldt x 57629 deb gebhardt x 39606 cathy phillips x 36898 john walt x 35379 debbie yates x 35305

Subject: re : meter 5892 daren : sorry it has taken so long to get back to this issue , i am with ees now . karen lindley allocates this point but i feel the need to help her because this issue came to light while i was in transition . exxon allocates this point and we receive a allocation statement from them on a monthly basis . december 2000 the total flow at the meter was 646 mmbtu . i copied esther garcia on this e - mail so that she can look into the possibility that there is a measurement error . esther will need to respond to karen on the matter of the possible measurement error . furthermore it seems odd to me that scheduling had 8 , 928 mmbtu confirmed at this point and only 646 mmbtu flowed . i would ask mark where he got his confirmed volumes from . as a temporary fix i reallocated the meter and gave the total flow to alpine resources . they will be short paid in their minds until ester and karen can get the possible measurement error issue resolved . i would also suggest that mark and karen get together to review the scheduling of this point so that karen can call exxon to reconcile their allocation with what we have ( the additional alpine deal ) at this point . charlene can redraft her invoice on monday 2 / 26 / 01 that will show the 646 mmbtu going to alpine . january 2001 again scheduling has 9 , 193 confirmed at this meter when on 3 , 241 mmbtu flowed . i temporarily reallocated the meter so that the entire volume that flowed went to alpine . they remain 10 mmbtu short paid but charlene can redraft her invoice and pay them something until mark ( validity of other deals at this point ) and karen ( exxon ' s allocation of this point ) can get this issue resolved . there is also the issue with the exxon transport at this point that was scheduled at 1 , 500 mmbtu per month for the months in question . this transport affects the allocation at the king ranch tailgate on the exxon 024 contract . i copied howard camp who will be training the contractor that will take my place in volume management so that he can stay on top of the resolution of this issue . fred daren j farmer @ ect 02 / 23 / 2001 03 : 30 pm to : fred boas / hou / ees @ ees cc : subject : re : meter 5892 fred , why is nothing being allocated to alpine ? this is a good deal we have in place with them and i really need the problem resolved . d - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - forwarded by daren j farmer / hou / ect on 02 / 23 / 2001 03 : 27 pm - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - charlene richmond 02 / 23 / 2001 02 : 36 pm to : daren j farmer / hou / ect @ ect cc : vance l taylor / hou / ect @ ect , donald p reinhardt / hou / ect @ ect , melissa k ratnala / hou / ect @ ect , melissa graves / hou / ect @ ect , fred boas / hou / ees @ ees subject : re : meter 5892 i need help ! john childres with alpine is getting made and wants to be paid . i have nothing to pay him . he is looking for payment of dec . 2000 , and jan . 2001 . john needs to pay his royalty owners . would someone please help me get this matter resolved . charlene richmond 02 / 21 / 2001 05 : 38 pm to : daren j farmer / hou / ect @ ect cc : subject : re : meter 5892 i spoke with karen lindley about volume not being allocated . she said that she passed it on to fred boas . daren j farmer 02 / 21 / 2001 04 : 46 pm to : charlene richmond / hou / ect @ ect cc : fred boas / hou / ees @ ees , melissa graves / hou / ect @ ect , karen lindley / corp / enron @ enron subject : re : meter 5892 i have done deals with john at this point . why are we not being allocated any volume ? d charlene richmond 02 / 21 / 2001 02 : 59 pm to : fred boas / hou / ees @ ees , daren j farmer / hou / ect @ ect , melissa graves / hou / ect @ ect cc : karen lindley / corp / enron @ enron subject : meter 5892 i am getting several phone calls from alpine resources demanding to be paid for meter 5892 and there is nothing there to be paid . the person name doing the requesting is john childers and he said that he spoke to daren farmer . he is looking for 859 mmbtu ' s for december , 2000 and 3 , 251 mmbtu ' s for january 2001 . this is on the katy gas unit . if anyone would like to talk to john his phone number is 281 - 646 - 0232 charlene x 31539

Subject: fw : status of cpuc proposed decisions on direct access suspension there was a discussion on this morning ' s call regarding the status of puc actions regarding da suspension . we requested a legal opinion from out outside regulatory counsel . it is attached . if you have any questions , please don ' t hesitate to contact sue mara ( 415 . 782 . 7802 ) or me ( 415 . 782 . 7822 ) . best , jeff - - - - - original message - - - - - from : mday [ mailto : mday @ gmssr . com ] sent : monday , september 17 , 2001 12 : 45 pm to : ' jeff dasovich enron sf ' cc : ' sue mara at enron sf ' subject : status of cpuc proposed decisions on direct access suspension jeff : at your request i am offering this memo to explain the status of the agenda items before the cpuc on the issue of suspension of the direct access program . there are two pending draft decisions at this time , the first is the proposed decision of alj barnett ( item h - 7 on the last agenda ) which was modified by a changed version submitted by pres . lynch at 2 : 45 pm on 9 - 5 - 01 , the day before the last meeting . this version indicated that direct access was suspended as of the date of the order ( which would have been sept . 6 ) and states in another ordering paragraph that the utilities are to advise their customers that the suspension is effective sept . 6 , 2001 , specifically naming that date . this order would have been interpreted to suspend direct access as of sept . 6 if it had been voted out that day . the other item , agenda item h - 7 a on the last agenda , is the bilas alternate decision which calls for hearings to determine the impact of direct access on the issuance of bonds , and does not suspend direct access at this time . please be advised that the suspension date contained in h - 7 can and probably will be changed before the orders are considered at the cpuc meeting on sept . 20 . either the sept 6 date will be changed to the 20 th of sept . , or some other specific date could be inserted at all the locations in the order dealing with the suspension date . all that is required to make this change is the distribution of a changed page on the escutia table before the commission meeting . thus , it is important for all direct access supporters to continue to urge the commission , especially commissioner brown , to support a suspension date later than sept . 6 , because it is so easy for the date to be altered under commission procedures . please let me know if you require any additional information on this subject . mike day goodin , macbride , squeri , ritchie & day

( wraps financial - creditquality - moodys and financial - defaults - s & p ) by jonathan stempel new york , oct 29 ( reuters ) - corporate credit quality will likely grow much worse before it gets better , and about $ 100 billion of corporate debt will likely go into default this year as the united states heads into recession , according to reports issued on monday by two top credit rating agencies . moody ' s investors service said it put ratings on review for downgrade for 122 u . s . companies with $ 543 billion of debt in the third quarter , dwarfing the 22 companies with $ 66 billion of debt it put on review for upgrade . reviews are a leading indicator of the direction of corporate credit . " a wide excess of rating reviews for downgrade over upgrades in the third quarter suggests credit deterioration will persist at least into early next year , " said john puchalla , moody ' s senior economist . meanwhile , standard & poor ' s said more than 200 companies will default on about $ 100 billion of debt this year , compared with 117 defaulting on a record $ 42 . 3 billion in 2000 . it said the default rate for junk bonds - those rated " bb - plus " or lower by s & p and " bal " or lower by moody ' s because of their credit risks - will reach 9 . 4 percent by year end . moody ' s forecasts a 10 percent rate . " the u . s . economy is clearly in a recession , " said s & p chief economist david wyss in a statement . " although standard & poor ' s expects it to be relatively mild and end in early 2002 , the risk of a longer and deeper downturn is high . " both agencies said the sept . 11 attacks contributed to a deepening of a three - year slump in corporate credit quality . moody ' s blamed 38 reviews for downgrade in september alone on the attacks . costs rise , protection weakens u . s . corporate credit quality is falling for many reasons . these include the weakening economy , the inability of many marginal companies to raise cash at tolerable interest rates , share buybacks , debt - financed merger activity , and fallout from the attacks on such industries as airlines , insurance and travel . " many companies in financial difficulties will see their funding sources dry up and be pushed over the brink , " said david keisman , managing director at s & p risk solutions . even well - known companies are suffering rating declines . on monday alone , for example , s & p downgraded mcdonald corp . after the world ' s largest fast - food chain said it will buy back up to $ 5 billion of stock , at a time s & p said the company ' s " growth prospects for the future are less optimistic . " meanwhile , moody ' s downgraded enron corp . , and warned it may downgrade it again . the energy trading giant is struggling with vanishing investor confidence , reflected in a share price that has plunged by more than half in two weeks , as it tries to keep access to cash it needs to run its business . puchalla said the credit quality decline could slow next year , in part because interest rates are low and companies are managing their balance sheets more conservatively . " lower borrowing costs and slowing debt growth should reduce debt servicing costs , and fiscal stimulus from the federal government should boost business revenues , " he said . still , through friday , moody ' s has said in the fourth quarter it may downgrade 47 companies , and upgrade just four . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . usa : u . s . firms say deals with enron at normal levels . by andrew kelly 10 / 29 / 2001 reuters english news service ( c ) reuters limited 2001 . houston , oct 29 ( reuters ) - major u . s . wholesale natural gas and electricity traders said on monday their deals with troubled enron corp . are still running at normal levels . but some are keeping a wary eye on the company ' s finances and credit status after a downgrade by one of the major rating agencies . " we certainly are very well aware of what our exposure is to them and watching that on a daily basis , " chief executive marce fuller of atlanta energy marketer mirant corp . told reuters . " at this point , i would categorize it as pretty much as business as usual with enron , but we ' ll have to keep a close eye on it as we move forward , " said fuller . officials at companies such as houston natural gas firm el paso corp . and columbus , ohio , utility holding company american electric power co . inc . expressed similar sentiments , saying nothing had changed in their dealings with the houston - based energy company , at least for the time being . " we continue to trade with them , " said spokeswoman jennifer pierce of charlotte - based utility duke energy corp . . " they ' ve always been meticulous in their credit management and we continue to see that with them , " she added . enron ' s shares fell to yet another new low on monday as the company said it was lobbying banks for a new credit line and rating agency moody ' s investor service downgraded the company ' s senior unsecured debt to two notches above junk - bond status . since oct . 12 enron ' s stock has fallen some 60 percent after the company reported its first quarterly loss in over four years , wrote down shareholders ' equity by $ 1 . 2 billion dollars and failed to quell investors ' jitters about a series of complex off - balance - sheet financial deals . confidence crumbles analysts say that if confidence in enron continued to crumble , it could restrict the company ' s access to credit and thus create problems for its core energy trading operations . european energy industry sources told reuters earlier on monday that there was already evidence of european companies shying away from trading with enron because of credit worries . several large energy groups have frozen their dealings with enron in europe as they hold urgent talks with the u . s . group about setting up new credit arrangements , the sources said . " they are talking with us about bank letters of credit , " said the head of risk management at one u . k . utility that halted its trade with enron last week . " the people that are still trading with them are doing so on a very restrictive basis . " traders in the u . s . wholesale energy markets said on monday that they were continuing to deal with enron and still regard the company as a reliable trading partner . " i don ' t have any problems dealing with enron , especially since i ' m doing day - ahead trades . but i have heard the rumors of people not wanting to deal with them , " one natural gas trader in the u . s . southeast told reuters . a trader who specializes in longer - term deals in the forwards market for electricity said publicity about enron ' s woes had not yet led to any loss of market liquidity . " obviously there ' s a concern , but the financial situation is not a factor now , " the trader said . despite the public words of reassurance that many of them have been speaking , enron ' s major competitors and trading partners continue to monitor the situation closely . " any time a counterparty starts looking like their credit rating is deteriorating , then that would certainly be a signal to us to become more worried , " said mirant ' s fuller . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . enron bonds stabilize but market players are concerned by michael c . barr of dow jones newswires 10 / 29 / 2001 capital markets report ( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones & company , inc . ) new york - ( dow jones ) - uncertainty about enron corp . ( ene ) continues to dog investors concerned about the future of the houston - based energy services company . " it ' s such a fluid situation that the market would like to see a clarification of the company ' s circumstances , " said eric bergson , portfolio manager , northern trust global investments , chicago . until this occurs , the outlook for the company ' s bonds is choppy , he added . enron drew down about $ 3 billion in credit lines last week to increase cash reserves and calm jittery markets , buying back its outstanding commercial paper . and , it ' s currently negotiating with its bank group for an additional $ 1 billion to $ 2 billion in new credit , according to a report in monday ' s wall street journal . enron ' s troubles began earlier this month with the announcement of a $ 618 million third - quarter loss and the disclosure of a $ 1 . 2 billion erosion of investor equity related to transactions conducted with its former chief financial officer , andrew fastow . " the company did not learn from the mistakes of others by not being ahead of the game on disclosure , " said mitch stapley , portfolio manager and chief fixed income officer , fifth third investment advisors , grand rapids , mich . it becomes harder to regain investors ' trust , he said . moody ' s investors service lowered the company ' s senior unsecured long - term debt rating monday to baa 2 from baal . the debt is rated triple - b - plus by standard & poor ' s corp . , with a negative outlook . fitch also maintains a triple - b - plus rating and it placed the debt on rating watch negative late last week . both fitch and moody ' s cited negative investor reaction to recent company developments . and moody ' s added that its " analysis of the developing situation will focus on management ' s success in lining up further liquidity support and on their ability to retain credit availability from their major counterparties .

" however , we do feel the move enron made to draw down their revolvers to pay off their commercial paper was a smart business move , " said stephen moore , vice president at moody ' s . the rating agency said it would review the prime - 2 rating on enron ' s commercial paper . last thursday , enron announced it had tapped its lines of credit to provide more than $ 1 billion in cash liquidity and that would it use $ 2 billion to pay down commercial paper . the decision to pay off the commercial paper , he said , accomplishes two goals . " it increases liquidity on a short - term basis , and additionally , it enables them to focus on other areas they need to focus on right now , " moore said . " they are working on setting up an additional facility for further capital to support their wholesale trading business . " karen denne , an enron spokesperson , confirmed monday that the company is in discussions with banks for further financing . additional credit would help boost enron ' s liquidity position . the lingering concern for moody ' s is that there " yet may be something else out there that gets to the credibility issue of enron itself , " moore said . at the heart of the credibility issue are two limited partnerships - - lmj and lmj 2 - created in 1999 by former cfo andy fastow and since dissolved . enron ousted fastow last week . see related story . " the market was unaware , " of the existence of the partnerships , moore said . " quite frankly , we don ' t think there is anything else , " he said . " but enron is huge , and if this could happen . . . there is a lingering concern that something else might happen . we cannot confirm or deny that this is true . we will be meeting soon with them to resolve issues such as these .

" should the wholesale trading business and the counterparties therein become impacted by these events , that could lead to the slowing growth of the wholesale business , the enron engine , " he said . moody ' s action monday also negatively affected the ratings on two trusts - - marlin water trust and osprey , which have combined debt of $ 3 . 2 billion . marlin is now rated baa 2 , while osprey carries a new rating of baa 3 , both down a notch . the potential issue for the trusts may be " how much equity enron would have to issue if the sale of the underlying assets alone isn ' t enough to pay off the debt .

enron said this morning that it is in talks with banks for additional credit , as declining investor confidence sent its stock to a six - year low and several large energy groups put their dealings with enron on hold . last thursday , the energy trader drew down about $ 3 billion from a credit line , causing its bonds to fall sharply on friday . enron ( nyse : ene ) has been scrambling to reassure investors and business partners since oct . 16 - - after the company reported its first quarterly loss in more than four years . the $ 638 million loss included $ 1 . 01 billion in charges on ill - fated investments . a week later , it disclosed that the u . s . securities and exchange commission had asked for information on partnerships run by chief financial officer andrew fastow and other executives . fastow was forced to step down from the company last week . the turmoil makes it clearer than ever that enron ' s problems weren ' t solved by the recent departure of chief executive jeffrey skilling . in these challenging times , enron deserves our thanks houston chronicle , october 28 , 2001 by bill white enron and its employees have blessed houston , and many houstonians should now take the time to say " thanks " when the company has experienced some highly publicized challenges . enron attracted thousands of great people to houston and changed houston ' s economy forever . the company ' s management encouraged their employees to be active citizens , and those folks responded by making a big difference in their community . enron ' s lead in shaping a nationwide market for electricity gave birth to a multibillion - dollar new industry , with houston as its hub . even while it competed hard to win in the marketplace , enron ' s example helped show other natural gas pipeline and trading firms how to move into the even bigger market of electricity . the downtown concentration of these firms - - industry leaders including reliant , dynegy , el paso and duke energy - - led london ' s financial times to refer to louisiana street as the wall street of electricity . this explosive growth attracted bright young people - - with the average age of enron employees at under 35 - - and they in turn helped fuel an explosion in residential growth in houston ' s downtown . this , in turn , helped revitalize downtown ' s retail and restaurant scene . enron ' s construction of a large class a office tower , still going up , is a milestone in houston ' s growth , an official end to more than a decade of large amounts of vacant office space . virtually every civic or charitable activity in houston learned to count on enron for both financial support and thousands of hours of invaluable volunteer activities . if enron or its chairman , ken lay , led a visionary effort , such as hosting the meeting of g 7 trade ministers , or more recently the private funding of the houston biotechnology center , houstonians knew it would be done right . without lay our town would have lost major league baseball and status as a big league town . employees know enron set a standard for hiring and promoting employees based on their potential , with no glass ceilings . women have run large divisions and subsidiaries . many military officers find that enron called on their talents after illustrious military careers , even at ages well past normal corporate entry level . the most highly recruited young people flock to a company that invests heavily in their training and then lets them rise as far and fast as their talent and ability to work hard would allow them . enron ' s corporate success reflects the stories of so many of its employees who have lived the american dream . with the habits of work learned on a family farm in missouri , ken lay got an education ending with a graduate degree at the university of houston , served his country in government and began a career in the gas pipeline business . when northern natural gas acquired the smaller houston natural gas , northern ' s chairman surprised folks by installing lay as his successor . i was at northern ' s headquarters in omaha the week after the merger 16 years ago when northern ' s chairman reassured folks that they could count on " best young executive in the business , ken lay , " to direct their future in a changing marketplace . within 15 years , most of enron ' s revenues and profits came from businesses that did not even exist when lay had taken over , all of which had been created from within the firm . this success did not diminish the farm boy decency and sense of fairness that attracted top talent to his team . enron rewarded innovation , while many firms afraid to alter the old formula wondered why their leadership eroded . year after year , top executives throughout the country voted enron our nation ' s most innovative corporation . enron recognized , even when financial markets do not , that innovative firms are secure enough to accept occasional failure and the inevitable price of other successes . rather than seeking insulation from the international marketplace , as had many american businesses , enron welcomed the challenge of the international market , confident that american firms could compete and win . enron also welcomed the challenge of responsible environmental stewardship , and called on industry to address the issue of global warming even as some companies feared the impact of pollution control on their bottom line . enron ' s phenomenal success created incredible and perhaps unreasonable expectations , as early this year when the stock market valued the company based on 20 percent annual growth , forever . enron ' s size and success made it a convenient target for politicians in california and india , even as enron supplied the electricity they so needed . sometimes it seemed the company ' s upstart origins as the david battling utility goliaths delayed the firm ' s perception that it had won and no longer played the role of an underdog . and so if enron experiences problems , it will learn from them , just as strong people do . let ' s not prejudge enron ' s current challenges . the more than a decade of my life that was dedicated to trying cases against companies who hurt consumers and investors taught me both to insist on the truth but never to jump to premature conclusions based on a headline or a news story . throughout its years of success , enron folks have never forgotten to find so many ways to make the firm ' s hometown of houston a better place to live and work . as enron enters a new phase of its life , let ' s not forget to express thanks and steady support . white is a houston business executive and civic leader and former government official , with no relationship to enron .

Subject: global standard on valuation methodology changes and model approval sally / beth , as we discussed when i was in houston i have put together a draft on valuation methodology changes and model approval . i had a meeting arranged for today to go through my proposal with ted murphy and tani nath ( she heads up research and structuring here in london ) but ted cancelled at the last minute ( again ) . tani and i met and are broadly in agreement , but before we can go any further we need ted ' s input . he is now away for 2 1 / 2 weeks so there is going to be no further progress on this front . in the mean time i would appreciate your comments on what i have put together . i would prefer it if it is not circulated around houston at this stage until i can accurately say that ted is happy from a global rac perspective . likewise i still need to get houston research comfortable but i am going to wait until ted has had a chance to add his feedback so i can at least say that it is only houston research that is outstanding . others will also need to be consulted ( and i would like to agree a list of key people with you ) but i can ' t see their being any real contention . can you ? i am assuming that resourcing is likely to be an issue for you in houston ( and it may well be here too ) and this has been added to the outstanding list . i am envisaging that some of the risk management work could be completed as part of the curve validation if there are any questions or feedback please let me know . james

Subject: el paso responds to ferc on expansion potential el paso says it ' s open to expansion of system el paso natural gas " is willing to expand its system " to the california border if " sufficient support " for such a project can be demonstrated through long - term capacity contracts , the pipeline told ferc . the pipeline ' s comments were in response to a commission inquiry asking el paso to consider the feasibility of upgrading its proposed line 2000 crude - oil conversion project to a system expansion to help ease the pipeline capacity crunch in the west . daniel m . adamson , director of ferc ' s office of energy projects , raised the prospect in a jan . 3 letter to el paso , saying that modifying the project " could assist the difficult situation " now facing the california gas market . specifically , the commission has recommended that el paso amend a pending application in which it seeks to acquire an existing 30 - inch diameter , 1 , 088 - mile crude oil pipeline from plains all american pipeline l . p . , and convert part of it to natural gas transportation service . the line extends from mccamey , tx , to bakersfield , ca . el paso plans to convert to gas service a 785 - mile segment from mccamey to ehrenberg , az . el paso proposed the line 2000 project as a loop line to replace existing compression , and not as a system expansion . however , " there are several ways that an expansion could be accomplished , " wrote el paso vice president al clark on jan . 15 . " el paso could add compression to the proposed line 2000 project , or it could replace or recommission the compression that the pending application proposes to abandon in place . " as a third option , he said el paso could add new compression to its existing system or loop either the existing system or line 2000 project . the " preferable method will have to be determined by a careful analysis of the relative costs and a determination of where shippers want the capacity , i . e . where they want to put gas into el paso ' s system and where they want the gas delivered , " clark said . as a " first step " towards gauging market support for an expansion , he noted that el paso on jan . 12 posted 1 . 2 bcf / d of california - bound pipeline capacity for sale effective june 1 of this year . the capacity currently is held by affiliate el paso merchant energy , whose contracts expire may 31 . when the posting results are known , " el paso will determine whether another open season is needed to solicit expressions of interest in additional pipeline capacity to serve markets both into and upstream of california . " if el paso finds there is an " unmet demand for additional capacity " on its system , the pipeline at that time " will evaluate whether an expansion of the existing system or a modification of the line 2000 project , or both , is the appropriate means of accomplishing the expansion , " clark noted . in the meantime , he urged the commission to approve el paso ' s application for the line 2000 project as it was filed . not only will the project " increase the operational flexibility " of el paso ' s current system , but converting the line from oil to gas service will be a " necessary prerequisite " to any future expansion of the pipeline ' s system , according to clark .

Subject: pure political phony an interesting anecdote about your good friend gray . . . . " this man , in his official capacity , has no nexus with the issue of power or energy and he has no nexus with the issue of ethics or conflict of interests , " south asserted . " he ' s a pure political phony . " the state renewed ethics attacks put davis on the defensive * politics : the governor ' s conflict - of - interest problems with his energy advisors give gop rival bill jones a ray of hope for his struggling campaign by mark z . barabak , times political writer in 1998 , when gray davis first ran for governor , his republican rival tested a series of attacks on davis ' ethical conduct . there were charges that he improperly used state workers in a previous campaign , accusations that he placed cronies on the state payroll and questions about possible conflicts surrounding davis ' voracious fund - raising activities . but when voters heard the allegations , they simply shrugged them off . the response was , " he ' s a politician . of course he does stuff like that , " recalled one gop strategist who sat in on the voter interviews conducted for republican nominee dan lungren . the campaign shelved its line of attack and democrat davis romped to a landslide victory . now he is under renewed assault for alleged ethical lapses , this time surrounding the state ' s electricity crisis . the issue has put the governor and his campaign aides on the defensive just as the state ' s power crunch appears to have finally eased . the charges have also invigorated the struggling campaign of bill jones , the republican secretary of state and davis ' sole declared rival in the race for governor . last week , jones called the conflict - of - interest allegations " one of the most significant , pervasive and costly " ethics scandals in california history . but as yet , there has been no evidence of profiteering on the part of davis ' energy advisors , let alone the governor himself . and unless there is some proof , many observers doubt that the revelations will seriously set back the governor ' s reelection prospects in november 2002 . " i don ' t see this becoming a dominant campaign issue , " said jim knox , executive director of california common cause , the good government group and one of davis ' most prominent critics . " it ' s likely that the more resonant issue . . . is going to be how well the overall crisis was resolved or not resolved . " that said , knox worries that the controversy will only contribute to the corrosive cynicism turned up in lungren ' s focus group interviews . " the danger is that this could undermine the public ' s confidence in state government ' s ability to resolve this crisis in their best interest , " knox said . " it does surprise me that the governor ' s office , with all of its experience and talent , could so cavalierly disregard the state ' s conflict - of - interest laws , which , to me , appears to be what happened . " the controversy involves nearly a dozen davis administration officials with financial ties to some of the major energy companies doing business in california . their investments surfaced months after the officials should have filed economic disclosure statements - - revelations that resulted , in part , from jones ' pressure . five of them have been fired and others are facing state or federal investigations . garry south , the governor ' s chief political strategist , points to the firings as evidence of davis ' probity . " clearly , if the governor ' s office did not feel there was a conflict of interest there , they would not have been fired , " south said . as for others in the administration who may have failed to promptly disclose their ties to the energy industry , " there is absolutely nothing illegal about anyone on the governor ' s staff - - or anyone in state government - - owning stock in any company whatsoever , " south said . even so , davis ' top spokesman , steve maviglio , earlier this month sold his 300 shares of stock in a california power company after news of his holdings surfaced . maviglio said he lost $ 1 , 300 in the transaction . at the least , the revelations have been a distraction for davis at a time when he would rather boast about a blackout - free summer . " it is a mistake that didn ' t need to be made and shouldn ' t have been made , " said gale kaufman , a sacramento campaign consultant and one of the rare democratic strategists willing to publicly criticize the governor . " the fact that it took a while to correct it creates an image problem he didn ' t need . " republicans , of course , see a larger problem . " he ' s either incompetent or there is corruption within his administration , " said rob stutzman , a spokesman for the california republican party . " and we think it starts with the tone and example he sets with those who work for him . " in characteristically pugnacious fashion , the davis campaign has sought to turn jones ' charges around by accusing the secretary of state of exploiting his public office for political gain . " this man , in his official capacity , has no nexus with the issue of power or energy and he has no nexus with the issue of ethics or conflict of interests , " south asserted . " he ' s a pure political phony . " but jones said political oversight falls well within his purview as the state ' s chief elections officer . " for the governor ' s office to say that i don ' t have any jurisdiction in this area or shouldn ' t be able to speak to it is patently false , " jones said . new life for jones ' campaign whatever his stake , there is no question that the attention has given life to jones ' campaign while he is fighting desperately to sustain his gubernatorial bid . the $ 960 , 000 in contributions that jones reported for the first six months of the year is embarrassingly small by california standards , and the bush white house has all but formally endorsed rival richard riordan , who is still exploring the race . ( fellow republican william e . simon jr . , a los angeles investment banker , has been campaigning for governor for months but has yet to officially declare his candidacy . ) but ironically , for all jones ' efforts , it may be riordan who is best able to capitalize on the ethics controversy . unlike simon , a political neophyte , and jones , an 18 - year officeholder , riordan had a decades - long business career before serving two terms as los angeles mayor . " he ' s cut from a different cloth , " said don sipple , a gop strategist who is neutral in the governor ' s race . " if this serves to remind people that politics is a slimy game , riordan can point to the fact he didn ' t start public service until he was more than 60 years old . " but even while insisting that davis did nothing wrong , strategists say voters will make a careful distinction between the governor ' s professional conduct and any evidence of personal enrichment . and davis ' best defense , they argue , is his famously modest lifestyle - - a frugality symbolized during his 1998 campaign by his cramped west hollywood home . if anyone thinks davis has used his office to get rich , one advisor said , " all [ wife ] sharon has to do is throw open the door to their condo . "

Subject: pserc denver meeting vince , the pserc meeting lance and i went to was both interesting and boring . pserc has 11 school members and 30 industry members . its research program consists of three stems : markets , transmission and distribution , and systems . ( enron ' s interests probably lie mainly in the first stem . ) in morning of the first day , researchers from universities presented their project proposals . i found some of them quite interesting . for example , shmuel oren , fernando alvarado , tim mount ( of cornell ) propose to study " market redesign : incorporating the lessons learned from actual experiences for enhancing market design , " shijie deng , s . oren et al propose to study " power asset valuation model in a market - based and reliability - constrained electric power system . " the first got funded but the second did not . in the same afternoon industry and academic separated to have their own discussion . i went to the academic discussion and lance the industry one . i hope my presence there did not make things worse , for the discussion revealed a lot of organizational chaos and confusion . the proposal screen process got a lot of heat from participants . the proposal process goes as follows : researchers first write a short proposal to appropriate stem committee ( no industry participantion , it seems to me ) , each committee then ranks the proposal and selects the top 3 or 4 . the selected proposals are then expanded to be present to the industry . industry then gets to vote which proposals get funded . however , some researchers were very unhappy about the initial ranking and selection process . there were accusation of self - ranking , communication between stem committee and member schools breaking down , and so on . some were even asking for some sort of assurance that the project will be funded even before wrting it ( the arguement was " then it was a waste of our time to write proposals " , which i found quite amusing ) . all in all , i found the process was not taken seriously enough by university researchers . pserc has been established for 5 years now and it still does not have a proper proposal screen process , which is hard to believe . also , the communication among university researchers , between stem committee and member schools , and most importantly , between researchers and industry , are not smooth as all . since the proposals are voted by 30 or so industry members , the " right " projects may not get funded . too many participants also make the decision process very indecisive and quite painful to watch ( lance can comment on this better ) . they also wanted to spread the fund among all schools which made the voting a less authoritive . i believe enron will not get much returns from join pserc ( price tag is $ 40 , 000 per company per year ) . if we find some projects interesting , we can sponsor the schools in the form of summer interns , the schools claim that most of the fund goes to support students anyway . alex

" deutsche banc alex . brown was among several brokerage firms downgrading fourth - quarter projections for natural - gas prices last week . " prior to sept . 11 , we were seeing signs that a lot of industrial demand was coming back , " said jay saunders , a deutsche banc analyst . " but all that is out the window now . " deutsche banc is now estimating a 20 % drop in winter demand in the industrial sector , which accounts for more than a quarter of total u . s . natural - gas consumption . the slack demand has resulted in supplies that have practically overflowed storage , which is on pace to be full by the end of october . while prices that are close to historical levels are good for consumers , such low prices could scare many producers away from making investments to ensure future natural - gas demand is met . lower prices have already led energy companies to slow their drilling and some firms , such as eog resources inc . , plan to moderate production in the next two months . gas drilling - rig counts fell to 953 last week from 1 , 030 at the end of august . even with the increased natural - gas drilling of earlier this year , overall natural - gas supply is expected to increase just 1 % this year , as the country ' s mature wells continue to be depleted faster than companies can replace them . the tight supply picture has analysts optimistic that prices will rebound next year amid lower interest rates , increased defense and relief spending and returning consumer confidence . still , the downturn could cause some firms to rethink or postpone projects to import gas in a liquid form . with prices high last winter , el paso corp . and enron corp . , among others , said they would build a dozen or so receiving terminals for liquefied natural gas , which is gas compressed and frozen to minus - 260 degrees fahrenheit . " you will see some cancellations and some delays , " predicts marshall adkins , an analyst with raymond james & associates in houston . natural - gas prices need to average $ 3 per million btus on the east coast and $ 3 . 50 on the west coast to justify bringing in lng to those areas , said ronald barone , an analyst with ubs warburg . a spokeswoman for el paso , houston , says the company is moving forward with at least three terminals for the u . s . market . enron said it is also pushing ahead with a terminal in the bahamas that would pipe the gas to florida starting in 2004 . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . enron leases part of mumbai estate to citibank freny patel mumbai 10 / 02 / 2001 business standard 5 copyright ( c ) business standard after months of scouting for a buyer for its one lakh square feet office space at wockhardt towers in bandra - kurla complex , enron has been able lease out 10 , 000 square feet of it to citibank na . against an expected realisation from rs 130 crore for the outright sale of its four floors , enron will get around rs 1 . 2 crore a year by leasing out one floor to citibank . the deal was struck recently by the global real estate consultant , cushman & wakefield , at a monthly rental of rs 100 per square foot . with property prices in mumbai having slumped and with no reprieve expected in the short run , companies are increasingly opting to lease space instead of blocking funds in illiquid assets . property consultants say that if enron manages to lease out the entire four floors , it will be easier for it to sell the property to a buyer , as the buyer would be assured of a fixed income . enron had eyed a deal of rs 130 crore when it mandated global real estate consultants to sell the premises at around rs 12 , 000 per square foot . this is despite the fact that real estate at bandra kurla currently fetches rs 8 , 000 to rs 9 , 000 per square feet . in june 2000 , the us energy giant had shelled out rs 125 . 75 crore when it acquired the four floors , plus car park space , from wockhardt , the pharmaceutical company . the deal was struck at rs 10 , 500 per sq ft , and included parking space for 101 cars . industry sources said that enron had spent a sum close to rs 150 crore to acquire the property , and pay for the interior furnishings of two of the four floors it had acquired . in order for it to break even , it would have had to sell its real estate at the rate of rs 13 , 000 per square foot . four to five global real estate consultants have been appointed by enron for the sale of its premises . a leading consultant said that it has been difficult to find any buyers for such a large property . " most international buyers prefer to take property on lease instead of an outright purchase , " he added . moreover , the inefficiency of the building in terms of the super built - up area is another reason why corporate entities are not too eager to acquire the premises , and enron ' s proposition continues to go abegging , said the consultant . copyright ? 2000 dow jones ranking includes 14 newcomers though hewlett - packard lost $ 65 billion in market value in a year , ceo carly fiorina hasn ' t lost her nerve , and for the fourth consecutive year holds the no . 1 position on fortune ' s ranking of the 50 most powerful women in business . the complete list and accompanying stories are in the october 15 issue of fortune , available on newsstands october 8 and at www . fortune . com at 12 : 00 p . m . on october 1 . in the no . 2 spot is ebay ceo meg whitman , who runs an internet company that actually makes money : $ 85 million in the last four quarters on $ 582 million in revenue . oprah winfrey , the queen of media , is mightier than ever , and holds the no . 3 spot , up from no . 15 last year . she produces movies , brings comfort and advice to millions of tv viewers , propels books to bestsellerdom , and , last year , teamed up with hearst magazines ' cathie black ( no . 28 on the list ) to publish o , the oprah magazine - by some measures the most successful magazine startup ever . at no . 4 is andrea jung , chairman and ceo of avon , who has breathed life into ailing avon . mirant ceo marce fuller - the only newcomer in the top five - holds the no . 5 position . inside a stodgy utility , southern , fuller built a high - growth trading and marketing unit , which was spun off in april . in these new , more tempered times , patience may be about to reap its reward . in fortune ' s annual survey of the 50 most powerful women in business , there is a clear emergence of women who came to power slowly . says fortune senior writer pattie sellers in " patient but not passive , " the story that accompanies the list , " by patience , we mean staying with a company , steadily building influence there , and rising to power through determination and insider knowledge , not promises and self - promotion . " fiorina , who has claimed the top spot each year since fortune ' s inaugural list in 1998 , heads the biggest company ( $ 48 billion in revenues last year ) run by a woman . and she is still as audacious and impatient as ever . wall street practically heckled her latest move - a bold bet to buy compaq - but fiorina , 47 , remains defiant . in difficult times , " people who drive change are the subject of great scrutiny , " she says . as always , the list is a snapshot of power at a moment in time . last year , power resided in the technology and internet sectors , but that influence was fleeting . gone from the list this year : deborah " hurricane debby " hopkins , who pushed her agenda too ambitiously at lucent and lost her cfo job in may ; ellen hancock , who failed at the startup , exodus ; and morgan stanley ' s mary meeker , who influenced so many to buy into the internet fizz . but one web warrior looks better than ever : meg whitman , no . 2 on the list . she has never overpromised to investors ; instead she has diligently delivered above - target profits every single quarter . fourteen newcomers join the list this year : marce fuller , president louise kitchen , coo , enron americas ; colleen barrett , president betsy bernard , president & ceo , at anne stevens , vp , north america vehicle operations , ford motor ; maria elena lagomasino , chairman susan desmond - hellman , evp and chief medical officer , genentech ; janet robinson , svp , newspaper operations , new york times co . ; carol tomi , evp and cfo , home depot ; carrie cox , evp and president , global prescriptions , pharmacia ; carole black , president and ceo , lifetime television networks ; janet davidson , group president , integrated network solutions , lucent ; larree renda , evp , retail operations , safeway ; and louise francesconi , vp and gm , missile systems , raytheon . while the economy and its points of power change , the criteria we use to evaluate power remains the same . says sellers : " we consider the size and importance of a woman ' s business in the global economy , her clout inside her company , and the arc of her career - where she has been and where she is likely to go . when appropriate , we also weigh the woman ' s influence on mass culture and society . that factor lifts oprah winfrey to no . 3 on this year ' s list . " the shifts on our list this year are dramatic , with 14 newcomers . but one trend is especially intriguing : women are taking on bigger businesses than ever . a few years ago , responsibility for a $ 3 billion business almost automatically earned a woman a spot on this list . no more . this year ' s fortune 50 includes several women who lead businesses with annual revenues of $ 20 billion or more , which is a first . in a related story , " it took a lady to save avon , " katrina brooker looks at andrea jung , chairman and ceo of avon . says brooker , " jung knows what women want and how to sell it to them . and that ' s what has made her one of the most successful ceos - male or female - in recent years . " over the past 20 months she has overhauled nearly everything about the way avon does business : how it advertises , manufactures , packages , and even sells its products , and she has done it not by abandoning the seemingly outdated avon lady , but by reviving her . the result : growth in revenues , operating profits , and operating margins . in addition , fortune includes an international list of the 50 powerful women in business . the top ten , featured in the magazine , are marjorie scardino , ceo , pearson ( britain ) ; anne lauvergeon , chairman , areva ( france ) ; mary ma , senior vp marianne nivert , president lien siaou -

" confidence has been shaken by the incremental disclosure . this is an extremely widely held stock and to assume that everybody listened to the conference call is probably asking too much , " said one analyst who asked not to be identified . the reduction in equity was prominently reported in the wall street journal on thursday , bringing it to the attention of a wider audience , analysts said . lay said the equity writedown and a corresponding reduction in the number of enron shares outstanding were related to the early termination of structured finance arrangements which had drawn criticism from some wall street analysts . as a result of the operation , enron ' s debt to total capitalization ratio will rise to about 50 percent , but the company expects the proceeds of asset sales to reduce the ratio to around 40 percent by the end of next year , lay said . moody ' s investor service said earlier this week that it had placed all of enron ' s long - term debt obligations on review for a possible downgrade because writedowns and charges had substantially reduced valuations for several enron businesses . some of enron ' s financing arrangements require the company to maintain investment grade credit ratings . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . brazil ' s copene , elektro plan to sell 820 mln reais of bonds 2001 - 10 - 18 13 : 53 ( new york ) rio de janeiro , oct . 18 ( bloomberg ) - - two brazilian companies have asked securities regulators for permission to sell 820 million reais ( $ 279 million ) of bonds , raising the amount of pending local market bond sales to 7 . 5 billion reais . brazil ' s copene - petroquemica do nordeste sa , a petrochemical company , has asked brazil ' s government for permission to sell 625 million reais of bonds according to the country ' s security and exchange regulator , the cvm . banco citibank sa , the brazilian unit of citigroup inc . , will manage the sale . elektro eletricidade e servicos sa , an electricity utility controlled by u . s . - based enron corp . that distributes electricity in sao paulo state , has asked for permission to sell 195 million reais of bonds , according to a cvm filing . no further details about the sales was immediately available . brazilian companies have scrambled to sell debt at home as the local currency , the real , plunges against the dollar , making dollar - denominated debt expensive and causing losses to mount as the local currency value of dollar debts soars . so far this year , about 9 . 1 billion reais of local market debt has been sold . meanwhile corporate bond sales in euros or dollars has slipped by almost two thirds to $ 1 . 7 billion in the third quarter from $ 4 . 5 billion in the second , not including sales through offshore subsidiaries , according to bloomberg data .

" [ t ] here is substantial and compelling evidence that the basis differential has been and continues to be grossly distorted by market power abuse , collusion and affiliate self dealing of out - of - state gas suppliers and merchants , " edison told the cpuc . the company noted the cpuc already has filed a section 5 complaint with ferc regarding this issue and is seeking a recision of " certain allegedly collusive contracts which it contends have permitted out - of - state natural gas suppliers and their affiliates to drive up artificially california border gas prices by wrongfully withholding capacity . " it notes the complaint " conservatively estimates that the anti - competitive manipulation of the basis differential has already damaged california gas and electricity users by $ 100 million annually since the beginning of 1998 . " edison seeks an expedited order authorizing it to use the posted gas price of $ 4 . 5133 / mmbtu , which was applied to sce ' s august 2000 avoided cost posting , to calculate its payment obligations to qualified power producers for the month of october and every month going forward . it estimated september bidweek border prices would average $ 7 / mmbtu . if such prices were used in edison ' s september avoided costs posting , its transition formula payments to certain independent power producers will be $ 29 million more than the month prior , the company told the cpuc . " no mechanism exists to recapture the increase in such payments if it is later determined by this commission or in another forum that the topock border indices are unreliable at this time . " - -

Subject: anthrax scare in dc house speaker hastert has decided to close the entire capitol complex , including the office buildings on the house side , at the end of the working day today through monday , as a precautionary move to allow for special agents and germ experts to conduct a sweep of the ventilation systems and all remaining unopened mail . the senate side is expected to do the same . it has also been confirmed that the anthrax - laden letter sent to senate majority leader daschle ' s office was of a particularly potent , high grade military quality anthrax that quickly spread once opened . some 29 staff in dachle ' s office or the mail room have tested positive , and some anthrax spores were found in the ventilation system of the hart building ( where daschle ' s office is located ) and in one of the tunnels leading to the capitol itself . if there is even a hint that this military grade anthrax came from iraq , there will be a strike by the u . s . against iraq . another possibility is that the anthrax is of russian origin and was somehow illicitly acquired by al qaeda or the taliban . there has not been a second anthrax letter or a new outbreak of anthrax , nor is there any evidence of anthrax spores spreading to committee rooms located in the other senate or house buildings . this was a pre - cautionary move by house speaker hastert , though it in no way diminishes how ugly the situation is .

( chairman kenneth lay says enron is cooperating with the sec inquiry . ) one partnership , run by enron chief financial officer andrew fastow , added $ 236 million in revenue in the first quarter of 2001 , boosting enron ' s $ 425 million in net income in that period . the partnership ' s contribution plunged to $ 5 million in the second quarter ended june 30 , but investors only found out aug . 14 - - when enron filed its quarterly 10 - q with the sec . oddly enough , that was the day chief executive jeffrey skilling unexpectedly resigned . expect class - action lawyers to go after the profits skilling and other insiders made by selling $ 660 million in stock when shares were flying high . ( they ' re down 78 % from august 2000 . ) since skilling left , enron has taken a $ 1 . 2 billion hit to shareholders ' equity to unwind partnerships . " they certainly misled the market as to the size of [ partnership losses ] , " says thomas shapiro , one of several lawyers filing shareholder suits against enron . who knows what will emerge from some of the other partnerships ? enron shares rise , rebounding from nine - year low ( updatel ) 2001 - 10 - 31 11 : 56 ( new york ) enron shares rise , rebounding from nine - year low ( updatel ) ( adds analyst comment in sixth paragraph . ) houston , oct . 31 ( bloomberg ) - - enron corp . shares rose as much as 19 percent , one day after falling to their lowest level in more than nine years , amid speculation the company may be a takeover target . shares of the top energy trader rose $ 1 . 58 , or 14 percent , to $ 12 . 74 in midday trading of 19 . 9 million shares , compared with the three - month daily average of 10 . 4 million shares . earlier , the shares hit $ 13 . 25 . shares of houston - based enron have fallen 84 percent this year . they have lost more than half their value this month amid a u . s . securities and exchange commission inquiry into partnerships headed by andrew fastow , enron ' s former chief financial officer . fastow was ousted last week in an attempt to restore confidence in the stock . ` ` there are rumors out there that they are a potential takeover target , but i think it ' s very unlikely that anyone will buy them out at this point , ' ' said zach wagner , an analyst at edward jones & co . ` ` there are too many uncertainties . ' ' enron is more likely to get a large cash infusion from an investor , wagner said . he has a ` ` reduce ' ' rating on enron shares . he doesn ' t own the stock . the wall street journal today said general electric co . ' s ge capital , warren buffett ' s berkshire hathaway inc . and royal dutch petroleum co . are ` ` among the names bandied about ' ' as potential buyers for all or part of enron . - - margot habiby in the dallas newsroom ( 214 ) 954 - 9452 enron shares rise as analysts cite bargain - hunting , financing speculation by christina cheddar 10 / 31 / 2001 dow jones business news ( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones & company , inc . ) dow jones newswires new york - - after losing nearly two - thirds of their value over the past two weeks , enron corp . shares regained some lost ground wednesday . bargain - hunting and speculation were said to be behind the buying , with some suggesting that enron is nearing a deal for additional financing , while others are said to be mulling the possibility the company may be acquired . in afternoon trading on new york stock exchange , enron shares ( ene ) were up $ 1 . 49 , or 13 % , to $ 12 . 65 on volume of 24 . 9 million shares . earlier , the stock traded as high as $ 13 . 25 . enron , which typically trades an average of 10 million shares a day , was again one of the most actively traded stocks on the big board . on tuesday , enron shares set a 52 - week low of $ 10 . 90 , which was the stock ' s lowest level in a decade . commerzbank securities analyst andre meade attributed the jump in enron ' s stock to investors attracted by its low price . those buyers , he said , are hoping not to be hit by the " double swords " hanging over the houston energy trader - - a securities and exchange commission investigation of the financial dealings of its former chief financial officer andrew fastow , with an off - balance sheet financing vehicle and the possibility of another credit - rating downgrade by moody ' s , which could trigger the need to issue additional stock and thereby dilute the holdings of existing investors . in addition , there is speculation " through the houston circuit " that enron may be close to securing additional financing , said prudential securities analyst carol coale . if the speculation proves true , the financing would help enron to shore up its financial condition and improve confidence among investors as well as its business partners . investors also may be placing their bets on the belief that enron shares have eroded enough in value to make the company a takeover candidate . a report in the wall street journal wednesday said several companies including general electric co . ' s ( ge ) ge capital unit , warren buffett ' s berkshire hathaway inc . ( brka , brkb ) and royal dutch / shell group ( rd ) have been named as potential buyers for enron . ms . coale said the takeover speculation was " unwarranted " and has surfaced each time enron shares faltered . " it would be very unusual . . . for a company to be interested in a takeover ( of enron ) given the uncertainty of the sec inquiry . why add that uncertainty to your portfolio ? " she said . furthermore , ms . coale said , it might be difficult for a company such as shell to clear regulatory hurdles because it already operates a substantial energy trading business . commerzbank ' s mr . meade also discounted the takeover speculation . he likened such a deal to the acquisition of a financial - service company . " you are buying a human - capital - based business . you have to make sure you ' re not going to loose all your people , " he said . " it ' s a trickier acquisition . " but not everyone thinks the takeover speculation is implausible . roger hamilton , an analyst at john hancock value funds , said shell and enron are " neighbors " , and shell has looked at enron " on and off . " still , he said that if there is a buyer for enron , the company would want to do it sooner rather than later in order not to risk damaging enron ' s leading market position . some marketwatchers said at least some of the pressure on enron shares in recent trading sessions has come from mutual funds liquidating their positions to avoid having the company ' s name appear among their holdings in their annual reports . despite the rise in enron shares wednesday , there remains a significant amount of uncertainty about the stock . in addition to the pending sec inquiry and the lingering credit concerns , attention also is being paid to their effect on enron ' s trading business . while several trading counterparties have said that they are watching the situation closely , at least one , entergy corp . ( etr ) , is said to be trimming its exposure to enron . the new york mercantile exchange also plans to use enron ' s weakness to recapture part of the over - the - counter energy derivative market by offering its own clearing services and trading tools for the natural gas market . write to christina cheddar at christina . cheddar @ dowjones . com copyright ( c ) 2001 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . enron trades higher after heavy losses by lisa sanders , cbs . marketwatch . com last update : 1 : 27 pm et oct . 31 , 2001 houston ( cbs . mw ) - - shares of enron , which had lost about 66 percent of their value over the past 10 sessions , spiked in wednesday trading after a report that pegged the beleaguered company as a takeover target . enron ( ene : news , chart , profile ) added 13 percent , or $ 1 . 46 , to $ 12 . 62 in recent dealings . volume was heavy at 25 million shares . john olson , an analyst at sanders morris harris in houston , pointed out that the heavy losses enron sustained over the last 10 sessions partly reflects the end of the tax year for mutual funds . the calendar year for funds ends at the close of business wednesday . " mutual funds who own enron stock have been trying to offset other gains by selling off enron , " he said . " mutual funds have to register all their gains or losses and offset them by selling or buying stock by the close today . " a wall street journal report wednesday speculated on enron ' s potential as an acquisition for a more stable company . enron has been under pressure for more than two weeks , beginning when the energy merchant reported a $ 1 billion charge in its third - quarter earnings . a securities and exchange commission probe into two of the company ' s limited partnerships and a rating downgrade by moody ' s investors service haven ' t helped . olson said he thought an enron takeover unlikely at this point . " however , if the stock were to keep coming down , and their financial difficulties were extended , the odds would increase , " he said . art smith , chairman and chief executive of the research firm john s . herold , said he ' d be surprised if enron was not entertaining offers . " it ' s one of the ways that enron gets the genie back in the bottle . " on the other hand , smith said , it would take a potential acquirer time to become comfortable with the valuation of the business . " it ' s doubtful that a potential acquirer can resolve all the valuation issues quickly , " smith said . he said it ' s likely that any sort of purchase agreement would contain what he called a " look - back provision , " which would protect the acquirer from being strapped to a fixed value . smith said he could see either general electric ' s ( ge : news , chart , profile ) ge capital or royal dutch shell ( rd : news , chart , profile ) making a bid . both were mentioned in the journal report . " ge capital is big enough that if it didn ' t work out it won ' t cripple ge , and they ' ve been opportunistic on things like this , " smith said . " and shell always keeps us guessing . " olson also included aig ( aig : news , chart , profile ) and citigroup ( c : news , chart , profile ) as potential acquirers . " enron has certainly had some appeal to people that are used to an aggressive trading culture , " he said . smith said that even without enron , the energy marketing and trading business would continue to thrive .

" you will need a lot of fortitude to see the mountaintop when we are in the depths of the valley , " said jay mueller , economist and portfolio manager at strong capital management inc . , which oversees $ 42 billion . the economy suffered its worst contraction since the first quarter of 1991 , the government said in its " advance " or early estimate of gross domestic product . gdp , the broadest measure of u . s . economic health , shrank 0 . 4 percent in the third quarter . the number still managed to beat economists ' projected 1 percent drop and helped spark an early rally . wall street still faces a heavy economic calendar this week and is girding for readings on the manufacturing sector and job market . some economists expect the u . s . economy will give an even worse performance in the fourth quarter as the sept . 11 attacks haunt the nation . the technology - laced nasdaq composite index advanced 28 . 65 points , or 1 . 72 percent , to 1 , 696 . 06 , after snagging a gain of more than 3 percent earlier in the day . sun microsystems inc . jumped 77 cents to $ 10 . 31 , or 8 percent , after the network computer maker said orders were tracking higher this quarter than they were this time last quarter . the dow jones industrial average was off 6 . 23 points , or 0 . 07 percent , at 9 , 115 . 75 , after climbing more than 1 percent . eastman kodak co . , down $ 2 . 69 to $ 25 . 11 , or 9 . 7 percent , pressured the blue - chip gauge after moody ' s cut its debt rating and warned it may lower the long - term rating again amid falling profits . the broader standard & poor ' s 500 index rose 4 . 03 points , or 0 . 38 percent , at 1 , 063 . 82 . the stock market had sold off in the last two days after rallying last week . wall street widely expects the economy to slip into a recession . but investors are hoping more tax cuts and lower interest rates will lift the economy by 2002 . president george w . bush urged congress to pass a stimulus package by the end of november in a speech at the white house . most economists expect the economic contraction to last at least to the end of the year and if it does , the third quarter would mark the start of the first u . s . recession in 10 years . a recession is loosely defined as at least two straight quarters of falling gdp . in other economic news , the national association of purchasing management - chicago said its october index slipped to 46 . 2 from 46 . 6 in september , but this beat economists ' estimates of a drop to 43 . 0 . the october index that showed less weakness than expected suggests regional manufacturing could bottom fairly soon , but does not necessarily mean thursday ' s national survey by napm will follow suit , analysts said . " what it ' s showing is that the economy , although it ' s slowing now , is slowing at a gradual pace as opposed to rapidly plunging off a cliff , " said john herrmann , chief economist at ideaglobal . " we think the napm index falls a little bit more than this because napm will capture corporations in new york and outside the region of chicago .

Subject: maybe tw should build into northern nevada . . . check this article out shippers condemn northwest ' s must - flow ofos several northern nevada industrial gas users have accused northwest pipeline of violating its tariff by holding them hostage to the daily must - flow operational flow orders ( ofos ) that it has issued since early december in an effort to compensate for the sizable capacity shortfall on its system . in a section 5 complaint filed friday , the industrial gas customers called on ferc to direct northwest to " cease and desist " the alleged violation of the tariff , which they claim is forcing them and other customers at the northern end of the pipeline to subsidize the gas acquisition and transportation costs of customers on the southern end of northwest ' s system . the effect of the must - flow ofos is to compel shippers to make up the capacity shortfall on northwest ' s system via displacement , the industrials noted . northwest ' s firm contractual demand is 720 , 000 dth / d , but its physical capacity is only 474 , 000 dth / d . pan - alberta gas ( u . s . ) inc . provides 144 , 000 dth / d through a displacement arrangement , while shippers are left to make up the remaining 102 , 000 dth / d . the industrial users contend they shouldn ' t be penalized for not complying with the must - flow ofos because northwest ' s tariff exempts shippers that have made " good faith efforts " to obtain gas supply , but have been unsuccessful . at issue is whether the " good faith efforts " applies to purchasing gas at reasonable costs , which is how the industrials interpret the tariff , or whether it means that shippers should be required to buy gas " at any price " to meet a must - flow ofo . the latter , according to the industrial users , is northwest ' s position . the " regulatory history " of northwest ' s tariff " makes clear that ' good faith efforts ' to obtain a gas supply at the stanfield [ or ] receipt point need not extend to purchasing ' gas at any price , ' but rather must be viewed in the context of current conditions and circumstances , i . e . available prices and supplies , " the industrial customers said . " where a shipper can secure gas needed to meet a must - flow order only at the basin price differentials that currently prevail , and assuming that the shipper can document such efforts and impacts for northwest verification , the shipper ' s request for exemption from penalties must be granted . " northwest twice has refused such a request by the industrial customers , they noted . in anticipation of the high gas prices this month , the nevada industrial users said they chose to switch to alternative fuels " where feasible " or to curtail operations rather than use their released capacity on northwest . nevertheless , the pipeline ' s daily must - flow ofos " have forced them into the volatile daily gas market to avoid extremely high non - compliance penalties , undermining their business decisions to rely on alternative fuels , " they told ferc [ rpol - 189 ] . in order to comply with northwest ' s orders , the industrials said they " must ship the gas to a point where they cannot use it , [ and ] can only sell it at the rocky mountain basin prices , which is a fraction of the price at which , under current conditions , they purchased it . " the industrial users said they have had to comply with northwest ' s must - flow ofos , given the hefty penalties they would face otherwise . the penalties are equal to the greater of $ 10 / dth or four times the highest spot rate at sumas , stanfield , kingsgate , opal or ignacio for the month of non - compliance . based on the spot rate at stanfield , the penalty this month was $ 58 . 15 / dth . if one of the nevada industrial users , newmont mining corp . , had defied northwest ' s order to flow 25 % of its contract demand , or 1 , 000 / dth , on any december day , it would have been penalized $ 58 , 160 for that one day , they said . if all of the nevada industrial customers had violated the pipeline ' s order , the one - day penalty would have been $ 149 , 471 . the industrial shippers want ferc to go beyond interpreting the " good faith efforts " exemption in their favor . they contend that northwest ' tariff allowing must - flow ofos " as currently structured " is both " unreasonable and unduly discriminatory . " that ' s because it requires one group of shippers , who see no additional benefits , to incur gas acquisition and transportation costs solely to subsidize service to another group of shippers , they argued . they believe the shippers who benefit should pay for the displacement capacity costs . currently , the must - flow ofos " result in southbound flows [ on northwest ] that create northbound capacity for the benefit of shippers with south - to - north entitlements . those same south - to - north shippers could , however , themselves purchase spot gas in the canadian supply areas and ship such volumes southward on an interruptible basis on northwest , i . e . do what [ the industrial ] shippers and others have been directed to do . they could pay the costs of the capacity that they want . " as an alternative , northwest could require a sharing of displacement capacity costs by all shippers using its system at a given time when capacity is short , or it could invest in facilities so that it has the physical capacity to meet all of its contractual commitments , the industrial users said .

Subject: california update 9 - 06 - 2001 for questions or comments regarding this report please contact g . britt whitman at ex : 5 - 4014 or kristin walsh at ex : 3 - 9510 . executive summary assembly ' s mou supporters " mia , " vote stalled bailout hang - ups : land , bonds , and referendum socal up for grabs ? mou support waning as of last night , assemblyman hertzberg reportedly had 25 votes in favor of the bailout that he could " count on . " there were 10 more votes that were " close " and stood a " reasonable chance " of being cast in favor of the bailout . however , that still left hertzberg 9 votes short of the 41 he needs . earlier today , sen . polanco , the bill ' s sponsor , privately indicated that the few remaining votes necessary to pass the amended sb 78 xx were in place due to lobbying efforts by gov . davis . no doubt the count will be close , but hertzberg will only take the bill up in the assembly for a vote today or tomorrow if he knows democrats can muster enough support . the key issues related to getting the 41 votes to pass sb 78 xx are the following : including the option to buy the transmission lines . for some this is a philosophical issue ; these members are quite adamant that the option to buy the lines needs to be removed from sb 78 xx . excess profits and creditworthiness - in particular how edison can use any profits . the philosophy underlying the bill itself as to whether a bailout is necessary given the experience with pg if the language comes out of the bill , the plan will no longer be acceptable to socal . socal : selling out or going under there is word in sacramento of companies " sniffing around " for a pre - packaged purchase of edison after the bankruptcy occurs . we will continue to investigate possible buyers and report when information becomes available . it is also rumored that if an " inadequate " bill passes - i . e . , one that will not return socal to creditworthiness - socal may declare voluntary bankruptcy , then use whatever bailout is passed as a revenue stream in bankruptcy . the only requirement laid upon socal is to attempt to go back into the market by january 2003 , and there is no penalty for them failing to do so . there appears to be nothing in the bailout bill that would preclude them from using money from the bailout in bankruptcy .

Subject: re : suncor inc . - extension of services arrangement awesome ! - - - - - original message - - - - - from : milnthorp , rob sent : wednesday , october 03 , 2001 9 : 02 am to : lavorato , john cc : le dain , eric subject : fw : suncor inc . - extension of services arrangement john , please see the attached . we are now 2 for 2 on extending our strategic alliances ( pcog keohane , peter subject : suncor inc . - extension of services arrangement rob , yesterday i finalized negotiations with suncor for the extension of the services agreement . suncor / sunoco management at the executive vp level have approved the term and general rates , and execution of a letter agreement on the extension is expected to be a formality . we will wait for execution of the agreement nevertheless prior to booking origination . deal : 1 . term - 3 years - january 1 , 2002 through december 31 , 2004 2 . services - as per todays services to all parts of the suncor and sunoco business , including their retail initiative . with respect to the retail initiative , we will only provide services to the retail company for its volumes up to 230 mmcfd . we provide services today for their current sales of 130 mmcfd . above 230 mmcfd we negotiate an additional rate . 3 . price : yr 1 = $ 475 , 000 cdn ; yr 2 = $ 487 , 000 cdn ; yr 3 = $ 499 , 000 cdn 4 . suncor gets a $ 70 , 000 cdn discount to be applied against the remainder of this year ' s fees , for the three months october , november , december 2001 the total base fee is $ 187 , 500 cdn - this will be cut to $ 117 , 500 cdn . 4 . agreement - enron canada will prepare a letter agreement capturing the extension terms , similar to petro - canada . 5 . incentive arrangement - as suncor is putting in place a new general mgr position to manage overall energy risks for the suncor group , we committed to wait for this person to be in place to negotiate an appropriate incentive arrangement . since we have provided the most value to suncor ' s consuming businesses over the years ( as e & p does very little ) it is appropriate to restructure the incentive to capture the value added to other parts of the business . enron ' s costs to provide the services are $ 168 , 444 cdn per year . this cost includes all accounting and operations staff , with an allocation of rent and infrastructure . we have five years of operating experience in providing these services and therefore are comfortable with this cost allocation . as in the case of the petro - canada renewal , the allocation of houston costs are insignificant on a per transaction basis compared to our base business . we do not include commercial staff in the above costs as they are covered through origination deal flow . we have made approximately $ 1 . 5 - $ 2 . 0 mm cdn each year ( including this year ) in deal flow from the suncor / sunoco alliance over the years of the relationship . the mtm income on this transaction is $ 830 , 000 cdn or approximately $ 530 , 000 us . i will allocate this amongst grant oh and myself . while the origination is not large on this transaction , the follow - on deal flow potential , based on past experience , is significant . again , as with petro - canada , we have a marquee client renewing services for an additional term with us after a five year initial term . this is a powerful marketing tool for the company vis a vis the quality of our services and commercial support . this renewal is a great credit to our operations , accounting , and commercial staff . we have had very few issues raised over the years with respect to the services provided in those areas , and have passed all audits performed by suncor . it also reflects very well on the hard work , and transaction / portfolio ideas of grant oh and nicole laporte on the commercial side ( and barry tycholiz and jason biever before them ) . this was not an easy deal to get done , in particular the three year commitment . you will recall that a year or so ago the odds of getting this done were probably 10 % . the key here was that we worked through and maintained relationships with up to five layers of the individual suncor and sunoco businesses , and we provided a very high level of service . peter , would you please prepare the letter agreement this week for this transaction along the lines of the pcog extension letter . i ' ll stop by to discuss further . thanks .

( i believe jeff needs to lay out a plan for achieving our vision , and as an economist , ken could give valuable insight into what ' s happening in the market . ) finally , i ' d welcome any ideas for an outside corporate speaker . i ' d very much like to have someone from a corporation that 1 . ) enron people admire ; and 2 . ) has undergone some difficult period in their company ' s history . jeff personally extended an invitation to steve ballmer from microsoft , but he is unable to attend . is there someone you think would be interesting ? i truly appreciate any consideration you can give this issue . i look forward to your thoughts and ideas . terrie james senior director , public relations enron broadband services ( ph ) 713 . 853 . 7727 ( fax ) 713 . 646 . 3248 terrie . james @ enron . com

Subject: call to bob glynn per our discussion this morning , below is a summary of items to discuss with glynn : adding enron ' s " negative ctc claim " to the list of claims : pge ' s filing included a list of top twenty creditors . our negative ctc claim was apparently not taken into account in compiling that list . the list is nonbinding , however . pg & e will be required to file schedules of creditors on april 20 . our negative ctc claim should be on schedule f ( for unsecured claims ) . you may want to remind glynn of your previous conversations and state our expectation that the negative ctc claim will appear ( preferably as uncontested ) in the april 20 filing . ( note : if pg & e does not include the claim we have an opportunity to file a proof of claim and ultimately the court determines the validity of the claim ) . including enron on the creditors ' committee : pg & e may have the opportunity to influence representation on the creditors ' committees . there are several reasons to suggest to glynn that we be included : 1 ) we are a big creditor , 2 ) we could be helpful in crafting a broader solution , and 3 ) we are one of the real parties in interest behind the px and iso ( who were listed as significant creditors but are really just " passthroughs " for the suppliers . . . and pg & e likely would not want to have those political bodies serving on the creditors committee anyway ) .

Subject: re : bridgeline cash and ar to all : as of today , bridgeline has $ 14 mm of cash and expects to get $ 15 mm from the payment of oct receivables by the end of the month . they have fully drawn down the $ 35 mm revolver that we put in place earlier this year . trevor mihalik ( bridgeline cfo ) is preparing a cashflow forecast for bridgeline from now to the end of the year and next year . bridgeline ' s major cash needs are to fund working capital ( payables and margin calls ) and to purchase gas that must be used to dewater the storage cavern ( enron # 1 ) that we contributed to the partnership . the dewatering process is now underway and will be completed mid - march 2002 . at a gas price of $ 2 . 50 and , working gas volume of 6 bcf , the total cash need for working gas will be approx . $ 15 mm . we are working with bridgeline to find other sources of financing for the working gas that would enable them to make ( and accelerate ) the 2001 cash distribution to the partners . alternatives we are considering to fund the working gas : ( i ) increase the revolver from $ 35 mm to $ 70 mm , ( ii ) find third parties ( enron ? ) to enter into park - and - lend arrangements that would give bridgeline the physical gas they need to dewater the facility without having to pay cash for it . most options will require chevron / texaco approval , which may come at a price . i will distribute the cash flow statement when i receive it and jean and i will meet with randy and trevor next week to discuss alternative financing / park - and - lend arrangements . i have been cloaking my questions on the need for cash under the guise of putting together the 2002 plan ( budget , headcount , capital needs , insurance requirements , etc . ) . we should adhere to this commercial context so that we don ' t provide leverage to bridgeline and chevron / texaco in any commercial discussions . i will admit , however , given the headlines , it does not take a genius to figure out we need cash . regards , brian - - - - - original message - - - - - from : kitchen , louise sent : friday , october 26 , 2001 8 : 46 am to : hodges , georganne cc : colwell , wes ; redmond , brian subject : re : bridgeline cash and ar brian redmond is working this - - - - - original message - - - - - from : hodges , georganne sent : thursday , october 25 , 2001 5 : 06 pm to : kitchen , louise cc : colwell , wes subject : fw : bridgeline cash and ar importance : high i am not sure when we received our last cash distribution from bridgeline but will check . should we pursue ? - - - - - original message - - - - - from : gruesen , karen sent : thursday , october 25 , 2001 5 : 03 pm to : hodges , georganne subject : fw : bridgeline cash and ar - - - - - original message - - - - - from : schwarzbach , emily sent : thursday , october 25 , 2001 4 : 41 pm to : gruesen , karen subject : bridgeline cash and ar karen , the following are the bridgeline account balances as of 9 / 30 / 01 that you requested : cash - $ 34 , 374 , 000 ar - $ 88 , 224 , 562 if you have any further questions or need additional information please let me know . thank you . emily

( 7 , 265 mws ) the ferc has investigated these outages and found no improprieties - just that the plants are overtaxed from running at higher than normal capacities . 2 . there are a lot of uncertainties surrounding the 1 , 244 mws of projected supply from rerating / restarting existing thermal and renewable projects . it is very unclear how much of this will be able to come on line by this summer , if at all . as evidenced by the e - mail i sent out this morning , local communities may be very opposed to restarting shut down units . in addition , these units are likely to be uneconomical . 3 . in the existing resource pool , there are roughly 1 , 430 mws of peaking or other generation units that are running up against their operating hour limitations from air quality regulations . the governor has ordered the local air quality districts to address these restrictions , we are beginning to seem some movement ; however , the us epa has yet to weigh in on these relaxed standards . 4 . the distributed generation / back - up generation capacity to make up some of the shortfall is still an unknown . while there has been some relaxing of the limitations on run hours for back - up generation at " essential public services " the increase in dg is expected from " clean " sources , not diesel emergency generators . 5 . the cec is doing everything it can to get 50 + mw peaking units on - line by this summer . they are promising a 21 - day permit application approval process and are offering to pay half of the cost of offsets , for " clean " sources of generation in critical areas . please let me know if you have any questions or need additional information . cec ' s summer forecasted peak demand - resource balance : list of peakers running into their operating hour limitations : also available in hard copy format only : ( please e - mail me your fax number if you ' d like a copy ) table 1 : fully executed ca iso summer reliability agreements ( the iso peaking facilities ) table 2 : summer 2001 supply options - renewables construction status summary table 3 : summer 2001 supply options - rerate of non - cec projects table 4 : summer 2001 supply options - cec rerate status summary table 5 : idle biomass plants potentially capable of restart mary schoen environmental strategies enron corp 713 - 345 - 7422

Subject: midmonth report : early warning - cera alert note : the following was sent out by cera and has a short term forecast of prices and alternate fuel pricing . note the price differential forecasts by basin . cera alert : sent wed , november 15 , 2000 title : midmonth report : early warning author : n . american gas team e - mail category : alert product line : north american gas , url : http : / / www . cera . com / cfm / track / eprofile . cfm ? u = 5526 likewise , a 5 percent warmer - than - normal scenario could decrease demand by 1 . 7 bcf per day relative to normal weather . fuel switching with natural gas markets this tight , there is significant pressure for demand to be backed out of the market . residential and commercial demand is inelastic to price in the short run , which leaves industrial demand and power demand as the only relief valve for the market . this winter we expect * all plants capable of burning residual fuel oil as an alternative to gas to do so * a loss of 700 million cubic feet ( mmcf ) per day of demand for power generation relative to last winter * industrial consumers to switch the equivalent of 500 mmcf per day off of gas * gas prices to act as a ceiling for residual fuel oil prices , as much as resid will act as a floor for gas for december cera expects an overall demand increase of 4 . 5 bcf per day relative to last december and a 14 . 4 bcf per day increase in demand relative to november , with increasing heating load offset somewhat by fuel switching . supply - the rebound the pressure from increasing demand and lower storage inventories is intense , but us supply is beginning to rebound . the recent steep decline in us lower - 48 capacity is expected to reverse in late 2000 , given the soaring gas - related rig count . * the success in reversing the decline in the gulf of mexico is related to the combination of - the ramp - up of the hickory and tanzanite subsalt discoveries on the shelf , adding to the recent startup of the muni field ; these fields could add over 0 . 5 bcf per day later in 2001 - the response of the shallow water to the strong late 1999 turnaround in drilling activity * other important capacity additions are occurring in the deepwater gulf of mexico , with 0 . 5 bcf per day in 2000 and 2001 , and onshore , led by the bossier sand play in freestone county , texas , the barnett shale play in wise county , texas , and the powder river basin coal seam play . * further increases in drilling are likely to slow . new deep land rigs are under construction and shallow rigs are being refurbished with cannibalized parts from older rigs . producers are experiencing delays in obtaining rigs as the supply of quality rigs depletes and drilling companies struggle to round out drilling crews . regional markets - wild winter in the west extremely cold weather in the west has brought rockies prices close to parity with henry hub prices and triggered early season spikes at sumas in the north and topock in the south . pipeline maintenance on el paso is exacerbating the regional demand pressure and has contributed to topock differentials of over $ 2 . 00 per mmbtu . tight pricing relationships to the henry hub in the san juan and rocky mountains should hold through february , with significant widening in differentials as heating loads decline . winter has arrived in earnest across north america , but the start - up of firm transportation service on alliance is delayed once again , this time until december 1 . nonetheless , flows on the pipeline are under way ; cera estimates that flows during october averaged 450 mmcf per day . during november that total should climb to 750 mmcf per day , despite the later published start date . with or without alliance flows , a weather - driven rebound in midwestern demand relative to november and december last year should keep prices in chicago at a significant premium to henry hub prices . in the northeast , differentials remain extremely strong and exposed to spikes throughout the winter , despite greater flows into the region from atlantic canada this year ( see table 3 ) . cera ' s outlook by region follows : * rockies . very cold weather within the region has brought rocky mountain prices near parity with henry hub prices . a break in the cold or a cold snap in the east will likely widen the differentials , but strong heating demand in the region will keep differentials within about $ 0 . 25 per mmbtu below the henry hub price . cera expects a december average differential of $ 0 . 25 per mmbtu ; however , this differential is expected to show significant volatility based on regional weather . a warm week in the rockies could still push differentials toward $ 0 . 50 per mmbtu . * san juan . san juan prices will continue to hold close to rockies prices through the winter , with significant pipeline capacity between the two regions . heating loads in the rockies will determine the san juan to henry hub differential , with extended cold weather in the rockies pulling both prices close to the henry hub price . cera expects the december differential in the san juan basin to average $ 0 . 20 per mmbtu . * permian and mid - continent . unlike prices within the rest of the west , differentials between the henry hub and the mid - continent and permian basins are likely to trade within a relatively narrow range during the winter , as supplies from those basins are pulled either east or west , depending on regional weather . cera expects a permian to henry hub differential of $ 0 . 11 per mmbtu and a mid - continent differential of $ 0 . 08 per mmbtu for december . * chicago . alliance flows into the chicago market are now running close to 750 mmcf per day . however , the onset of the heating season has offset those increased flows and pushed chicago differentials up to near $ 0 . 15 per mmbtu relative to the henry hub , despite delays in the completion of the vector pipeline . cera expects the strong pricing at chicago to continue , and december differentials should average $ 0 . 25 per mmbtu . * northeast markets . assuming normal weather , we expect to see december basis for new york relative to henry hub at $ 1 . 03 per mmbtu . new england will likely see prices $ 0 . 05 - $ 0 . 15 higher , depending on the pipeline . much of this increased basis differential is caused by fuel costs . for example , with a 9 percent retention rate from the gulf coast into new england , last december would have seen retention costs of approximately $ 0 . 22 ; at $ 5 . 70 , that same retention equates to $ 0 . 50 . despite additional volumes of gas deliverable into the northeast from the atlantic canadian fields , there have been no additional regional pipeline facilities to deliver this gas to the local markets , and an additional 166 , 000 mmbtu per day of potential demand will compete for the capacity . because of this tightness , should this month ' s weather be colder than normal , we could see severe spikes in basis similar to those seen in january 2000 . these spikes could even exceed the highs seen in january , depending on the severity of any cold snaps and the extent to which new electric loads are realized . canadian markets - winter begins the colder - than - normal weather has increased demand in western canada but is only now being felt in the east . storage peaked in the west in early october at approximately 225 bcf below last year ' s level and 6 bcf below the five - year average . even with modest withdrawals since that time , storage inventories are still estimated to be adequate to meet winter needs . easter canadian storage has continued to grow , pushing levels to over 245 bcf , 11 bcf above last year and well above the five - year average . with the eastward movement of the colder weather , withdrawals are likely to begin . this higher level of eastern storage will be useful with the expected reduction of flows on transcanada . the good news resulting from the cold is a more normal " freeze - up , " which bodes well for a longer winter drilling season . gas well completions are expected to reach 8 , 500 for 2000 and will likely be even higher next year . further delays for alliance ? the " commercial " in - service date for alliance has been delayed until december 1 , the result of a combination of problems with clearing the line , delays in the completion of the aux sable liquids extraction plant , the delay of vector , and a lack of supply . the pipeline has been flowing gas , however , with volumes building up since september . it is estimated that flows for november will average 750 mmcf per day . transcanada has taken the full brunt of the alliance flows so far , with northern border and pgt remaining strong . december should see alliance flows build to between 900 and 1 , 000 mmcf per day , with modest reductions in flows on northern border and pgt . storage withdrawals will likely keep transcanada reductions close to 350 mmcf per day , year - over - year , until vector begins service to eastern canada . high prices : strong pull west the high demand in the pacific northwest has also provided strength for aeco . the aeco - henry differential has dropped to the high $ 0 . 30 s and low $ 0 . 40 s as a result of this increased pull . for december , the differential is expected to average $ 0 . 50 per mmbtu , for a resulting aeco average of c $ 6 . 97 per gigajoule ( us $ 5 . 10 per mmbtu ) . * * end * * follow url for pdf version of this message with associated tables . cera ' s autumn 2000 roundtable event dates and agendas are now available at http : / / www . cera . com / event account changes to edit your personal account information , including your e - mail address , etc . go to : http : / / eprofile . cera . com / cfm / edit / account . cfm this electronic message and attachments , if any , contain information from cambridge energy research associates , inc .

Subject: projected fund giving george - here is one statistical method ( linear regression ) , applied to hosanna ' s fund giving . the method is deterministic , where contributions each sunday are attempted to be explained by significant events on the church ' s and members ' calendars , and the method shoudl be considered in contrast to an anecdotal one , where each sunday ' s giving might be estimated to be the average giving of the same sunday ( e . g . , each 2 nd sunday in january ) in the past . the following effects are estimated independently by the computer ( they add and subtract with each other accordingly ; some sundays can have more than one effect " in play " ) : 1 ) most positive for giving : an additional + $ 8 , 802 for special pastoral appeals ( 3 of them in the past 3 years ) 2 ) positive for giving : an additional + $ 2 , 551 easter and nearest - christmas " sunday , " an additional + $ 59 thanksgiving sunday , and a tiny additional + $ 1 each week pure time trend . 3 ) negative for giving : - $ 304 for sundays of monday federal holiday weekends , and - $ 9 during the summer ( june 1 - aug 31 ) 4 ) " wave " : there is an $ 80 per week " wave " - giving $ 80 higher one week , $ 80 lower the next , etc . . . the computer can explain roughly 60 % of the absolute variation in giving the past 3 years using this approach . keep in mind , much of the information , statistically , is captured in the pastoral appeals , easter and christmas sundays , and holiday weekends . the rest of the variation cannot be explained by this simple model ( i . e . , it looks like " noise " ) . here are the predictions for fund giving for the upcoming year . you can cut - and - paste these numbers to any file or spreadsheet you like . they may seem " boring " to you ; please remember they are the deterministic components of a process that involves a lot of volatility , and your church ' s actual experience will predictably be volatile . these numbers are as - if the " means " of experiences dependent on the " standard deviations .

Subject: request for training session folks , i am a vice president with enron , and have been with the company some 6 years now . i was hired through enron associate pool , and started off by marketing power on the east coast with jim fallon . currently i am working in the india region , looking into different ways to develop merchant type activities in india , anticipating the start of trading activities some time in the future . one of my challenges is to make the team in india aware of the type of sophisticated operations and processes that we have in place for trading activities , as well as the range of products we have to offer . i have been in conversation with mike mcconnell and jeff shankman on the global products side , and are planning a session to acquaint the team in india with activities in that group . similarly , on the power side , we have been interacting with john sherriff ' s team in london . i feel that it will be very beneficial for some of the team members to get acquainted with the processes on the power trading side in houston , and to get an idea of the rac process , the research side , the back - offices , as well as the trading operations here . similarly , the team there could present to you the state of the market in india , and give you an idea of the type of opportunities there . i am therefore eliciting your support to put together a session in houston where they can be acquainted with these functions , as well as the people responsible for them in the us . there are three people in the group who would benefit from this exposure . one of them is from the associate pool , while the other two are people hired locally in india . i have already spoken with our coo , wade cline in this regard , and seek your support in putting together an agenda for such a session . please let me know who i should contact within your groups to discuss this further . regards , sandeep .

Subject: pastoria update - revised power asset development dash the pastoria dash each of you signed last week has been modified at the request of jeff skilling and rebecca carter . late friday afternoon , west power was advised to value the gas transportation on a pvl 0 rather than var basis . the impact of this change was to increase the cost of the gas transportation from $ 34 mm to $ 102 . 3 mm . the $ 102 . 3 mm is a worst - case scenario in that it assumes none of the capacity can be resold . also , rac has advised that no new signatures will be required for the revised dash . the revised dash will be considered by the enron executive committee this afternoon in a special meeting along with other projects . attached for you convenience are ( 1 ) the original dash ( dash dev final dg . doc ) , ( 2 ) the final dash before the executive committee ( dash _ pastoria 4 _ 030901 ) and ( 3 ) a redlined comparision of the final to the original ( dash _ pastoria 4 _ 0309091 _ redlined ) . most all highlighted changes reflect the substitution pv for var . a few minor changes were also made . should you have any questions , please do not hesitate to call me at 713 . 345 . 8992 .

last week a couple of heavy hitters left money on the table . mark mcgwire , the home - run - hitting baseball player for st . louis , retired . and he let it be known that he never signed a two - year , $ 30 million contract his agent negotiated last spring . why ? because he wanted to find out if his injured right knee would allow him to play as well as he had before . it didn ' t , and he decided he wasn ' t worth that kind of money . then ken lay , chairman of enron corp . , said he won ' t take the $ 60 . 6 million he had coming to him in a severance agreement that comes into play when enron is sold to dynegy corp . of course , neither mcgwire nor lay will ever have to consider my fallback retirement plan - sacking groceries at the supermarket , carrying them to the car and hoping for a big tip . still , it was a class act on both their parts . mcgwire only hit . 187 last season , well below his lifetime average . and lay ? well , let ' s say that rarely in the history of american capitalism has a company sunk as fast as enron . remember that earlier this year its stock hit a top of $ 82 a share . now it ' s hovering in the single - digit level , and enron is being forced to sell itself to a smaller rival . the stock price incentive how did enron get into this position ? put the blame on the company ' s relentless drive to push up its stock price . and a big reason for that push comes from the way american companies compensate top executives . in the last couple of decades , executive compensation has soared . the average chief executive officer today makes 531 times as much in salary , bonuses and stock options as the average factory worker . apologists for executive pay say these kinds of figures really aren ' t relevant . most of the money top executives receive doesn ' t come from base pay or bonuses but from stock options . such options usually work this way . executives are given hundreds or thousands of shares of stock that they can only buy from the company at a future date . the sales price can be anything from 10 cents to the price of the stock on the date the options were granted . if the stock increases past the exercise price in the option , the executive can buy the stock and then sell it , making big bucks . it the stock has dropped below the option price - it ' s underwater , in the jargon - then those options are worthless . granting options aligns the interests of the top executives with the shareholders , those who favor this sort of incentive say . and that ' s true , if you talking about in - and - out traders . but it ' s not true if we ' re looking out for the interests of the majority who hold stocks for the long term . keeping the debt hidden keeping its stock price soaring was what brought down enron . to hype the stock , enron ' s execs were hiding the debt it took on to fuel its amazing growth and some of its dicier investments , in partnerships . enron was supposedly only a minority partner in these deals . that way it could move a large portion of its debt off its books in that partnership . that , in turn , made the company ' s earnings look better . when enron ' s executives finally fessed up , they had to write down their profits over the past few years by 20 percent . but the real irony here is that 80 percent is still a heck of a lot of money . but by that time , the majority of shareholders simply had no faith in enron ' s bookkeeping . now look at lay ' s compensation . in 1999 he exercised stock options and made $ 44 million on them . in 2000 , sales of options brought him $ 123 million , and this year about $ 26 million , according to a study published by bloomberg news . was lay deliberating deceiving investors to keep his stock options profitable ? i don ' t think so . he was simply following the latest fad in corporate governance . he was aligning himself with the interests of the shareholders . the shareholders were happy with that high stock price . nobody - besides some stock analysts - complained about enron ' s often - impenetrable bookkeeping until that stock price started to fall . would enron ' s bookkeeping have been different if top executives received fewer stock options ? maybe . fewer stock options would mean lower pay for the top guys . and no one would want that job if he were only going to make $ 10 million a year instead of $ 100 million . just kidding . copyright ?

' 01 p / e : - - ( source : bloomberg financial markets ) copyright ? 2000 dow jones section 3 investing bullish , and patient , on energy stocks by jan m . rosen 11 / 18 / 2001 the new york times page 8 , column 2 c . 2001 new york times company despite last week ' s plunge in the price of crude oil and in shares of big oil companies , some wall street analysts remain upbeat about the long - term prospects for energy stocks . ' ' these very dramatic downturns are great buying opportunities , ' ' said tina vital , an oil and gas analyst at standard & poor ' s , who recommends a broad group of integrated oil companies , including exxon mobil , chevrontexaco , royal dutch / shell , bp and totalfinaelf . ' ' they have excellent management , a top dividend yield and are a safe haven for investors , ' ' she said , provided that investors are patient and can bear short - term swings . last week ' s price declines were set off by russian oil companies ' refusal to accept demands by the organization of the petroleum exporting countries for big production cuts . they were a reminder that the sector is extremely volatile . ' ' oil could go to $ 10 a barrel short term , ' ' she said , but there is no certainty of that . the oil producers could reach an agreement by january , sending prices upward . over the long term , she expects to see production cuts . demand for energy has grown only 0 . 5 percent this year , and prices have been declining for some time for both crude oil and gasoline - - as drivers have seen at the gas pump . west texas intermediate crude closed friday at $ 18 . 03 on the new york mercantile exchange , up 58 cents from its thursday close , the lowest since june 1999 . but an economic recovery , expected by late 2002 , could cause demand to pick up , analysts say . as oil prices have dropped , so have the prices of most oil stocks , but not as much as the overall market since the beginning of 2000 . over that period , the s . & p . energy index has lost 8 percent , while the s . & p . 500 - stock index is down 23 percent . a report issued last week by the energy department said that while the sept . 11 terrorist attacks had intensified the country ' s economic slowdown , ' ' they are not expected to result in any long - term volatility in energy markets . ' ' the report estimated that commercial energy demand would rise 1 . 7 percent a year through 2020 , instead of the 1 . 2 percent predicted only a year ago . its predictions assume increased use of computers and office equipment , and slower increases in fuel efficiency for cars and trucks . while they warn of the possibility of wild price shifts in the months ahead , other analysts are similarly bullish for the long term . l . bruce lanni , senior oil analyst at a . g . edwards his 12 - month target is $ 34 . ' ' we remain confident , ' ' he said , ' ' that the company ' s annual oil and gas production should grow by about 4 percent , on average , over the next several years . ' ' conoco ' s debt , at 55 percent of capital , is relatively high , but he expects the company ' s strong cash flow - - it equaled $ 5 . 33 a share last year - - to reduce the debt level to 46 percent next year and to 38 percent in 2003 . the company ' s after - tax interest cost is only 3 . 5 percent , he said . mr . lanni also favors kerr - mcgee , a natural gas exploration and production company , and bp , calling both undervalued . he regards exxon mobil , royal dutch / shell and chevrontexaco as fully priced , so he is not recommending buying them now . ' ' if you own them , hold them , ' ' he said . william featherston , executive director and an oil and gas exploration analyst at ubs warburg , said he felt ' ' near - term caution but medium - term optimism for sustainably higher ' ' natural gas prices . he said he would encourage investors to consider buying shares of exploration and production companies over the next two months . his top picks are apache , kerr - mcgee and eog resources . such stocks are highly volatile , he said . they are ' ' trading - oriented vehicles , and short - term volatility in commodity prices generally provides the most attractive entry and exit points , ' ' he said . ' ' while natural gas prices declined throughout most of this year , prices rose at a startling pace , from $ 1 . 75 per million cubic feet at the end of september to over $ 3 per million cubic feet within weeks . ' ' he cited three reasons for the price rally : a decline in gas surpluses , predictions of a colder - than - normal winter and what he has called ' ' pathetic third - quarter natural gas production , ' ' despite record drilling activity . the tangled finances of the enron corporation were also a factor in the recent price increase for natural gas futures , he said . enron , which marketed 25 billion cubic feet a day of natural gas , or more than 40 percent of the nation ' s demand , is under investigation by the securities and exchange commission and announced a $ 1 . 2 billion reduction in shareholder equity from deals with partnerships involving its former chief financial officer . it also reported a third - quarter loss and restated earlier earnings . enron has agreed to be taken over by dynegy , a smaller rival , for about $ 9 billion in stock . dynegy is also assuming about $ 13 billion in debt . anxiety over whether the enron investigation would disrupt deliveries or have other market repercussions led to an increase in prices . while it is ' ' difficult to quantify the enron factor , ' ' mr . featherston said , the short - term effects on natural gas prices seem to be over . other factors , of course , could also mean a bumpy ride for energy investors over the next several months . the status of the war against terrorism , president bush ' s decision to fill the strategic petroleum reserve , thus helping opec in reducing excess global capacity , and a united nations review of the food - for - oil deal with iraq expected in december could each have a significant impact on battered oil prices . nevertheless , ms . vital said , for the long term , energy will probably be in short supply , and new sources must be developed . so she also likes the prospects of two drilling companies , noble drilling and nabors industries . both took a beating last week , along with the oil companies , so again she sees buying opportunities . bern fleming , portfolio manager of the axp utilities income fund in minneapolis , who has stakes in dynegy , duke energy and dominion resources , said all three had good prospects for growth , thanks to a mix of assets , ' ' management i respect and solid business plans .

it will take months , if not years , to untangle the details , but it is clear that the main culprit was greed , closely followed by hubris . not too many years ago enron was a small , struggling , gas pipeline company in houston . as deregulation spread to more and more states , enron began acquiring pipelines , gas producers and utilities . it also acquired friends in high places , especially the bush family and their key political advisers . and , it discovered it could make money faster by selling and trading energy than by producing it . enron sold many of its generating plants and became the biggest " power broker " in the nation . though it was by no means the largest winner in the con game that bilked california consumers of tens of billions of dollars , enron was one of the first power barons to take advantage of california ' s flawed deregulation law - - virtually written by in - state and out - of - state utility companies . the california fiasco soured ( probably ) most americans on utility deregulation , but enron was not singled out for calumny , and management saw no reason to examine its business ethics . contrarywise . management had visions of even greater profits , which it felt no obligation to share with ordinary stockholders . the chief financial officer and other high - ranking executives set up affiliated or subsidiary partnerships which made deals with enron . i do not understand the details of these arrangements , but neither do independent accountants , the securities and exchange commission or congressional investigators . it does seem clear that the enron insiders made millions for themselves . enron acknowledges , without explaining , that stockholder equity dropped $ 1 . 2 billion in the last quarter and that it had for the last five years overstated profits by some $ 600 million . whether this was by design or by mistake is in dispute , but it is the sort of thing which tends to undermine the confidence of investors . so much for greed . back to hubris . it seems not unlikely that enron ' s leaders felt they might not be punished for a modest amount of corner - cutting because they had friends in high places . the chief executive , kenneth l . lay , was and is a personal friend of george w . bush and has easy access to the white house . for many months after the new administration took office , karl rove , bush ' s top political strategist , owned enron stock valued at $ 100 , 000 to $ 250 , 000 , and sold it only after he had been able to secure a ruling that he did not have to pay capital gains tax immediately because he sold to avoid a conflict of interest . lawrence lindsey , the president ' s chief economic coordinator , and i . lewis libby , vice president cheney ' s chief of staff , owned stock in enron , and lindsey was paid $ 50 , 000 last year as a consultant for enron . enron and its employees gave more than anyone else to bush ' s four political campaigns - - one ( unsuccessful ) for congress , two for governor and one for president . in 2000 , enron and its employees gave $ 113 , 000 to bush ' s campaign , $ 250 , 000 to the republican national committee , and $ 300 , 000 to the presidential inauguration committee . cabinet appointments affecting energy policy , key sub - cabinet appointments , administration action or inaction in the california energy mess , and the overall energy policy of the administration could hardly have been more favorable to the interests of enron . and now a couple of questions : is it possible the unusual financial maneuvers by enron went unnoticed or even unsuspected by all the savvy texas oilmen in the bush administration ? were those of them with heavy investments in enron unconcerned about the conduct of the company ? was enron right in thinking its friends in government would not be in a hurry to investigate or to reprimand ? or , in light of our preoccupation with terrorism , will the enron case get much attention from the federal government ? or from voters ? waldo proffitt is the former editor of the herald - tribune . copyright ?

" many americans , contemplating the losses they ' ve suffered this year in the stock market , might say there was nothing " best " about what happened to them - - in fact , nothing good at all , perhaps other than that it might have been worse . with share prices on the rise again , the damage to portfolios has been lessened . even so , stocks will have to post strong gains in the next six weeks to keep this from being the market ' s worst calendar year since 1977 . the blue - chip standard & poor ' s 500 index rose 1 . 6 % last week , but it ' s still down 13 . 8 % year to date . yet those losses , while certainly not trivial ( especially when they ' re yours ) , can obscure what arguably are some very positive aspects of this year ' s experiences . with investing , adversity can be a more important teacher than success . if you ' re having trouble this thanksgiving week finding reasons to be thankful about anything investment - related , try these on for size : * " asset allocation " is no longer just a quaint theory . the paramount investing rule has always been to spread your money around to reduce risk . but it took the worst stock bear market in 25 years to bring this lesson home for many people who thought equities only rose in value . now , millions of investors have a far better appreciation for just how much they can lose in stocks - - and how bonds and short - term cash savings can offset market losses and preserve capital . it has been a hard lesson , to be sure . but investors who take asset allocation to heart will be laying a much more solid foundation for their money in the long run . and don ' t underestimate what that can mean for your peace of mind long term . * the wisdom of saving money on a regular basis has been relearned . in the late 1990 s , many economists lamented how the u . s . savings rate continued to shrink . some people felt there was little need to put significant new sums into savings when the stocks or stock mutual funds they owned seemed to be rising nonstop . in other words , many americans were letting the stock market do their saving for them when share prices were rising 20 % or more each year . now , with shares down and with the likelihood of much more moderate returns on stocks in this decade , it ' s clear that many people will have to find a way to save regularly if they ' re going to meet their long - term financial goals , especially retirement . this may not be a pleasant reality , but it ' s better for most people to have faced this fact sooner rather than later , while there may be time to make up lost ground . * a healthy skepticism has replaced mindless euphoria about stocks and those who tout them . the market ' s slide has discredited a legion of wall street analysts , money managers and others whose knowledge , understanding and judgment were clearly lacking , in retrospect . investors have come to see that having blind faith in those who present themselves as " experts " is a highly dangerous strategy , if it can be called a strategy at all . sure , it may have been more fun when technology stocks were shooting the moon and nobody had much use for reviewing a company ' s fundamentals . but that wasn ' t investing - - it was speculating , and on a massive , and ultimately ruinous , scale . people have learned to be less trusting about what others say about the market , and that is more likely to be beneficial than detrimental to their portfolios in the long run . just ask anyone who shifted their entire 401 ( k ) retirement savings sum into aggressive - growth mutual funds in the first quarter of 2000 - - right before the market peaked - - because of the bullish comments of some 25 - year - old tech stock analyst . those investors aren ' t likely to make a move like that again . * free - market forces are weeding out the weak players and the phonies . capitalism may be harsh , but it ' s efficient when the good times end and it ' s time to find out which companies truly have talent and staying power - - and deserve more capital . hundreds of dot - coms have failed , but who really misses them ? is it any harder to find what you want on the internet ? it probably would have been much worse for all concerned if those companies had sucked up investors ' funds for another year instead of failing when they did . but the market isn ' t just eliminating small companies that never had much of a future . the financial near - collapse of energy giant enron corp . exposed a business that twisted accounting rules to its own benefit - - to the point that the company now concedes that financial statements all the way back to 1997 " should not be relied upon . " also to be weeded out , though over a longer time period , will be mutual fund managers whose performance running other peoples ' money has been a nightmare for those investors - - meaning , the returns produced have been far worse than what the investors would have achieved in the average fund in that particular sector . these managers know who they are - - and , hopefully , their shareholders know by now as well , and will vote with their feet . the free market also is reminding cartels just how tough it is to control prices . once again , the organization of petroleum exporting countries has lost its ability to prop up crude oil prices , which have sunk to two - year lows amid the weak global economy . that ' s lousy for opec , but it ' s great for every energy consumer . * the market ' s woes have altered many investors ' priorities for the better . the wild bull market of the late 1990 s demanded peoples ' attention , and got it . for some , stocks became an obsession . their portfolios dominated their lives , especially if they were actively trading shares . they believed they were going to be rich , or richer , and that it was all because of how smart they were . now , most people have been humbled by the market . in the process , some have realized that they don ' t want their mood determined by their portfolio ' s day - to - date price changes . the sept . 11 terrorist attacks , of course , also changed many peoples ' view of what truly matters to them . money is important , but you aren ' t your stocks , and they aren ' t you . life is more than a daily stock quote . * tom petruno can be reached at tom . petruno @ latimes . com . for recent columns on the web , go to www . latimes . com / petruno . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . financial investing james k . glassman don ' t be a pudd ' n ' head , diversify james k . glassman 11 / 18 / 2001 the washington post final hol copyright 2001 , the washington post co . all rights reserved warren buffett , who was probably the greatest investor of the 20 th century , is fond of quoting the salacious actress mae west as saying , " too much of a good thing can be wonderful . " in the market , such a motto would lead you to avoid diversification and instead concentrate your portfolio in stocks you really , really like . peter lynch , who was probably the best mutual fund manager of the 20 th century , calls spreading yourself too thin " diworseification . " smart , witty and brilliant at picking stocks , buffett and lynch may not need diversification , but the rest of us do . when you own one stock , you ' re out on a limb . for example , very few analysts - - with or without a conflict of interest - - predicted that shares of enron , the energy and trading company , would tumble by 90 percent in a year . put all your eggs in a basket like that and you end up with a gooey mess . the more stocks you own - - as long as they are in different industries - - the more the overall riskiness of your portfolio is modulated . the reason you don ' t want a super - risky portfolio is simple : while warren buffett may be calm and prescient enough to ride out severe dips in the value of his holdings , most investors are not . a portfolio that increases in price by 10 percent each and every year is worth exactly the same at the end of three years as a portfolio that falls by half the first year , rises by three - quarters the second and rises by 52 percent the third . but reasonable investors prefer the consistent ride . it prevents them from doing something stupid , such as selling all their stocks after losing half their money during that first disastrous year . consider the sad case of james d . mccall , who earlier this month resigned as manager of the merrill lynch focus twenty mutual fund . two years ago , merrill wanted mccall ' s services so desperately that the firm went to court to pry mccall away from his previous employer , pilgrim baxter , where he rang up impressive gains in the late 1990 s . ( his big success was called pbhg large cap 20 . ) and when they got mccall , merrill ' s brokers raised more than $ 1 . 5 billion from their clients for him to invest . while the average growth - stock mutual fund owns about 100 stocks , with the top 10 holdings representing about one - fourth of the portfolio ' s total value , mccall specialized in what are called " concentrated portfolios . " in the case of merrill lynch focus twenty , he owned , as the name implies , just 20 stocks . at last report , his top 10 holdings accounted for a whopping two - thirds of the fund ' s assets . if mccall had spread his 20 stocks among , say , a dozen different industries , he might have smoothed his ride . instead , 69 percent of his assets went to technology firms . the focus fund and a smaller one that mccall ran called premier growth were launched in march 2000 . within just 17 months , all but $ 650 million of the clients ' original $ 1 . 5 billion had vanished . it is hard to imagine losing as much as focus twenty did even if you tried . as of nov . 9 , the week mccall resigned , the fund was down 72 percent for the year , compared with a loss of 14 percent for the standard & poor ' s 500 - stock index , the benchmark for fund managers . according to the latest report from morningstar mutual funds , 19 of mccall ' s 20 stocks had declined during 2001 , the only exception being harley - davidson . more amazing , 16 of the 19 losers had fallen by at least half . ( by the way , enron was mccall ' s seventh - largest holding . ) " this fund has had a wretched existence , " wrote morningstar analyst kunal kapoor , who did admit a grudging admiration for mccall ' s perseverance . mccall ' s " faith may turn out to be well placed over time , " kapoor said . unfortunately , time ran out . my point here is not to pick on mccall but to reveal the perils of concentration . buying focus twenty as a technology fund , and consigning it to no more than one - fifth of your holdings ( with the rest of your assets in diversified , conventional stocks or funds ) might have made sense , but focus twenty was touted as a " long - term capital appreciation " fund , not a sector fund . here , it failed , but maybe it didn ' t have to . the manager who made the concentrated fund popular , tom marsico , who ran janus twenty , took care to spread his holdings around . his successor , scott schoelzel , has suffered losses lately ( he is down 28 percent year - to - date , but that ' s after a total gain of 546 percent in the preceding five years ) , but they have not been nearly so catastrophic - - and for good reason . schoelzel ' s last report lists among his top 10 holdings three tech stocks , two financials , one drug company , one energy firm ( whoops , enron again ) , one industrial , one consumer - durables company and one services firm . for investors in individual stocks , the important question is this : how much diversification is enough ? some risk is inherent in even the broadest portfolio . this is called market , or " systematic , " risk . over the past 75 years , market risk , as measured in standard deviation , has been about 20 percent . in other words , in two - thirds of the years the annual return of the s that is , between a loss of 9 percent and a gain of 31 percent . that ' s still volatile , but if you invest in stocks you have to live with it . what you don ' t have to live with is anything more volatile . so your objective in building a portfolio is to try to approximate systematic risk and avoid what is called " idiosyncratic , " or extra , risk . a portfolio with just a few stocks , or one like mccall ' s , that is overloaded in a single sector , has lots of idiosyncratic risk . in 1977 , an influential study found that investors could nearly eliminate that extra risk by owning just 20 stocks in a wide variety of sectors ; in fact , owning eight or 10 stocks depressed risk sharply . recently , however , the market has appeared to be far more volatile , and a new study by a group of economists headed by john campbell of harvard found that many more stocks were needed - - around 50 - - to bring a portfolio down to the same level of riskiness as the broad market . what campbell ' s group found was that neither the market itself nor individual sectors had become more volatile in the 1990 s , but that stocks within those sectors had , so you need to own more of them . but owning 50 stocks is a pain in the neck - - and it brings up the buffett - lynch admonitions about too much diversification . it is hard just to take the time to make the selections , but even buy - and - hold investors need to keep track of the companies they own to spot adverse changes in management , product failures or new competition ( not to mention enron - style accounting shenanigans ) - - signs that it ' s time to sell . one good answer is to achieve balance by owning a combination of mutual funds and stocks . for example , you might want to put 50 percent of the money you have allotted for stocks into a fund that mimics the s & p itself , like vanguard index 500 , which charges rock - bottom expenses and guarantees that risk won ' t exceed systematic levels . you could also consider a broad fund that ' s managed by human beings , such as meridian value or baron growth , which are recommended by sheldon jacobs , editor of the no - load fund investor newsletter . then another 25 percent of your holdings can go into a few sector funds that specialize in technology , real estate , energy and small - caps , and the final 25 percent into a portfolio of 10 to 20 individual stocks . ( i own 16 , at last count . ) there are many valid variations . just don ' t emulate mark twain . in a letter to clients recently , anthony m . maramarco of david l . babson & co . , the cambridge , mass . , investment firm , recalled the aphorism of twain ' s pudd ' n ' head wilson : " put all your eggs in the one basket - - and watch that basket ! " unfortunately , such a philosophy emphatically does not work in stock investing - - as twain himself learned when he sank nearly all his fortune into the paige linotype , a machine that flopped . we all make mistakes . ( it was twain , after all , who pointed out that " human beings are the only animals that blush - - or need to .

2000 dow jones over many years they have pointed out that all the benefits of deals , and often more than all , accrue to the shareholders of the companies taken over , while investors in the bidding companies suffer dilution . investors know this , and in normal market conditions news of a takeover will depress the bidder ' s share price . but in a bubble market these prudent attitudes can be overwhelmed by euphoria , as well as technical factors relating to demand by fund managers so that they can maintain their weightings when a bidder is spraying around large quantities of new equity . also , it is irrational that many more deals are done when the stock market is high than when it is low . two years ago , companies such as marconi were engaged in buying sprees at daft prices . now , when prices are much lower , hardly any acquisitions are being made ( and investment banks are dismissing thousands of employees ) . an exception to the deal famine is gold mining , which just happens to have been one of the stock market ' s strongest sectors this year . another important source of irrationality has been the domination of stock market analysis by the stockbroking offshoots of the investment banks . over recent years their earnings - per - share forecasts for the next calendar year have been on average 8 per cent too high . this has not just been a mistake ; they have been paid to be over - optimistic . admittedly , attempts are being made to restructure the incentives here , as the embarrassed investment banks come under pressure from the regulators and the courts for their errors of judgment during the bull market , but it remains to be seen whether much will really change . the mystery is why anybody would take notice of these forecasts , and indeed many professional investors do not . that merrill survey , incidentally , shows that fund managers on average expect no more than 4 per cent earnings per share growth over the next year , while the stockbrokers ' analysts are still clinging to the hope that it will be 15 per cent . a final source of distortion is the tendency of companies to offer their executives the wrong sort of incentives . the ruin of marconi may appear irrational , when multi - billion - pound acquisitions are being declared worthless after only two years . but executives with lucrative stock option plans , which pay off if their gambles go right , combined with golden goodbye and pension packages that are triggered if things go wrong , may well consider it perfectly rational , from their viewpoint , to take much bigger risks than other shareholders , or employees , would consider acceptable . moreover , sir christopher gent , shareholders of vodafone will remember , received a controversial # 10 m personal bonus last year for clinching the mannesmann takeover , a deal that requires # 10 bn of write - offs . in normal market conditions the valuation of equities may be tolerably rational , but in a bubble market the rules are thrown out of the window . many investors certainly like the idea of getting rich quickly . that is why many people subscribe so keenly to national lotteries in which the chance of winning is so small as to be not worth rational consideration . barry . riley @ ft . com .

' ' enron ' s stock drop led moody ' s investors service to cut the company ' s debt rating to the lowest investment grade . dynegy held off on a purchase agreement out of concern that the rating would be cut to junk , jeopardizing enron ' s ability to raise cash needed to settle its daily power and natural - gas trades . enron may reveal where it expects to cut jobs and how much it will pay to departing employees , paik said . chief operating officer greg whalley said last week that fourth - quarter profit will be hurt by severance payments and reorganization costs . he didn ' t give details . jobs likely will be eliminated in businesses the company plans to sell , including its money - losing telecommunications unit and operations in europe , analysts said . enron has about 21 , 000 employees , two - thirds in the u . s . and about a fifth in the u . k . its 600 traders are divided between london and houston , where enron employs about 7 , 500 . many enron workers are already preparing for layoffs , said lyndon taylor , a houston - based recruiter for heidrick & struggles international inc . , an executive placement firm . ` ` i got 56 resumes last week from enron , ' ' taylor said . ` ` that ' s equal to the number i got in the past year .

Subject: california update 1 / 31 / 01 please do not hesitate to contact robert johnston ( x 39934 ) or kristin walsh ( x 39510 ) with additional questions . executive summary an announcement could be made as early as today regarding the first wave of long - term contracts ( price and term ) . the threat of bankruptcy is significantly diminishing as davis hatches a plan to 1 ) pass on " court ordered rate increases " and 2 ) issue revenue bonds . audit results are in and questions loom about the amount of funds transferred to parent companies . davis is expected to use the threat of " endless appeals " in courts and a possible ballot initiative in november to keep the pressure on the parent companies to pay a share of the utility debt , as well as to limit the scope of the rate hikes . davis hopes that a court ruling in favor of the utilities would provide him with the political cover he needs to pass on rate hikes to california consumers and avoid utility bankruptcy . davis walking a fine line with consumer advocacy groups . if there is a ballot initiative in november to challenge the expected court - ordered rate hikes , it could be disastrous for investor confidence in the state . legislation and bail out bill ablx was heard for several hours in the senate appropriations yesterday . issues still remain regarding the tiered rate structure , specifically for communities that have harsh climates . however , the bill has received support from almost everyone including consumer groups . the bill is expected to pass sometime today . tim gage , ca director of finance said davis supports all the provisions in ablx and expected to sign . bill abl 8 x was not heard in the assembly yesterday but is expected to be hear today . in committee hearings monday , the dwr testified it is spent all of the $ 400 m and were spending $ 45 m / day in the spot market to buy power . according to sources with direct access to governor davis , the on - going court battle , as discussed below , is viewed as an excellent opportunity for a settlement . davis recognizes that 1 ) the expected court ruling in the cpuc case will likely authorize the utilities to increase rates charged to california rate payers ; 2 ) despite that ruling , the state government has the ability to delay the eventual reward of that order long enough to cripple the two utilities unless they come to terms . thus , davis believes that california consumers cannot avoid getting hit with higher electricity charges , but he plans to use the threat of an appeal ( and a possible ballot initiative ) to limit the amount of the rate hikes . a plan to exempt the lowest income , smallest consumers from any rate increase and to concentrate rate increases among consumers using 130 % of a baseline usage rate was gaining serious momentum last night in sacramento . that would still hit about one half of all consumers ( since the " baseline " is set at 60 % of average consumption ) , but it is " progressive " in a politically important sense . making this work would require solving a minor crisis that erupted last night when pg & e admitted they had stopped reading electricity meters for many customers and were estimating their bills based on previous usage rates . the company ' s defense ( they had laid off meter readers to conserve cash ) was met with widespread derision as consumer advocates pointed out the estimation policy conveniently allowed the company to charge more despite serious efforts by californians to use less electricity . " every time you think there ' s a moment when these utilities will not embarrass themselves , something like this happens , " one legislator moaned . long - term contracts a second key to keeping the eventual rate increases down lies in the negotiations now almost complete for the first wave of long - term power buying contracts davis initiated earlier this month . the first wave of those contracts will be announced perhaps as early as today and they will be surprisingly positive , according to officials in the talks . " we got a series of good offers in those initial proposals . and some not so good ones , " one official told our source . " the idea is to announce the results of the first contract talks with the good guys and then go back to the others and say , ' you want in on this with these terms ? ' we think we ' ll eventually shake loose a lot of supply with this strategy . " bankruptcy because of these new dynamics , there is improved market confidence that california will emerge from the current energy crisis without bankruptcy for socal edison and pg & e , even as they are set to miss another round of payments to creditors and suppliers today ( remember , there is a standstill agreement among creditors not to ask for accelerated payment until feb . 13 ) . we believe that sense of optimism will be given an even more credible boost by the court case in front of us district judge ronald s . w . lew in los angeles , which is likely to mushroom into the kind of political cover for elected officials that make a settlement possible by the end of next week , at the latest . in fact , without that political cover it would be impossible to square all the various circles of this crisis . audit results and ballot initiatives markets , bush administration officials , and perhaps utility companies themselves are underweighting the possibility that citizens groups will launch a successful ballot initiative in the fall of 200 l to bring all electricity generation back under state control . the threat of a proposition initiative mounted as the two audits of the utility companies ordered by the california public utilities commission released in the last 48 hours confirmed two seriously damaging points we have been warning about since mid - january . first , the audit of socal edison confirmed that $ 2 billion of the debt the utility claims it owes to energy suppliers is actually owed to itself through its corporate holding structure that generates and sells power . second , it confirmed that edison electric paid nearly $ 5 billion in profits to the holding company which then used that money to buy back its stock and increase dividends in an effort to keep its stock price up even while it was going on a debt - issuing binge . the audit of pg & e released late last night was even more damaging : pg & e management was sharply criticized for poor decisions in failing to react to " clear warning signs of an approaching energy crisis " by not making deep spending cuts , " including scaling back management salaries . " the auditors also questioned the utility ' s decision to funnel some $ 4 . 7 billion of its profits since deregulation into the coffers of its parent holding company , which then used the cash mostly to pay dividends and buy back stocks . " basically , they took the money and ran , " as state senate speaker burton put it yesterday . what appears to be governor gray davis ' grudging acceptance of reality is actually a highly evolved effort to produce a solution that provides enough rate hikes / taxpayer subsidy to help solve the current crisis without triggering a new - - and far more damaging - - burst of populist outrage among a voter base that still thinks the utility companies are basically making this all up . there is no doubt that this use of money by socal edison and the debts it owes to itself are perfectly legal and in keeping with the spirit of the 1996 deregulation law , but that is irrelevant in popular political terms . were it not for the political cover potentially afforded by the court case discussed below , these audits would make settlement extremely difficult . keeping that anger from exploding into a ballot initiative this fall is key to understanding the very complex game that davis , his advisers and senior legislators are now playing . a ballot initiative would be a potential disaster since it would almost certainly be aimed at re - establishing full public control over the electric utilities . even if the state and utilities successfully challenged such an initiative in court it would be years before that victory was clear and it would freeze all new private investment during that prolonged period . that ' s something california cannot afford as businesses would be moving out and new ones failing to relocate . court battle thus , legislators are listening in horror as they hear the ugly details of the court case in los angeles that socal edison and pg & e are likely to win in mid - february . the court will most likely grant the two utilities $ 12 . 7 billion in relief and that the cost would fall immediately on the shoulders of consumers who would see bills rise by at least 30 % , california politicians could see the emergence of the one thing everyone has needed since the start of this extended drama : political cover . davis will then have to rely on his political and negotiating skills to pressure the parent companies of the utilities to pass on something less than the full $ 12 . 7 billion debt . pg & e and socal edison have already won round one of a legal battle designed to let them raise electricity rates enough to recover all of the debt they have accumulated since august last year when the puc refused to let them raise prices even as electricity prices soared . the court said the 1996 deregulation law was crystal clear - - when the two utilities had repaid so - called " stranded costs , " they were free to begin charging whatever they needed to charge consumers to cover their cost of acquiring power . although the utilities won this case , the judge stayed his order until february 14 th at the state government ' s request . as that deadline approaches , an intense new negotiating round is under way . on the one hand , political officials know they have the ultimate political cover for higher electric prices ( " the courts made me do it " ) , but on the other hand , they also know that immediate and full compliance with that court order would force electricity rates up by about 40 % on top of natural gas bills that have soared by about 300 % since last year . utility companies are playing this card aggressively in negotiations about the scope and shape of the final bailout . " we ' ll just wait until the court puts the order into effect in mid - february then even if we are in bankruptcy we will emerge quickly and easily . " one tactic the state political officials are using , in order to force a settlement , is the threat of keeping the law suit tied up in court for the next couple of years . one political official pointed out that they could keep the utilities from receiving their money this year , next year or perhaps even the year after . " sure , we tell them , they will probably win in court and get that money . eventually . we are making them well aware that unless we have a settlement we will appeal that court ruling all the way to the supreme court and keep them tied up for the next two years at least . we don ' t think the creditors will be quite that patient .

Subject: ngi ' s transwestern article article in today ' s ngi . . . natural gas intellingence , wednesday , december 6 , 2000 transwestern adds receipt and delivery points transwestern pipeline is going through a growth spurt with eight new interconnect projects in service or under way , which will add 300 mmcf / d in market area deliveries and 285 mmcf / d in new supply receipts . the new or expanded connection points will enhance shipper access to both new supplies and markets . " there is not a direct relationship between the two [ delivery and receipt interconnects ] , " said jeff fawcett , a transwestern representative . " it is kind of coincidental in nature that they came at the same time , but we have ongoing activities to connect new supply and create additional opportunities for gas to both be received into transwestern as well as be delivered out of transwestern .

Subject: working paper list & etc dear vince : i have put together a list of finance working papers ( some of which i brought to the interview last wednesday ) which i have written since 1995 mostly in support of my work but also ( at least initially ) as a learning tool . several of them , however , do contain innovations . i have asked ms . de claris to forward a copy to you . as i expressed to you earlier i am particularly interested in enron credit swaps trading platform and the business opportunities that it will spawn . i also think that there are tremendous opportunities to be explored in the secondary mortgage maket in the us . i do not know if enron has considered or is active in this market . this would be an area that i am also very interested and in which i think much better can be done than most of the players in the street . the question in my mind ( hopefully not prematurely ) is : if there is interest here would enron consider letting me put together this business ? i look forward to hearing from you soon . best regards joao

Subject: third quarter earnings results today , we announced our third quarter earnings results , which were right on target with analysts estimates for recurring earnings per diluted share of $ 0 . 43 . this marks a 26 percent increase over the third quarter of last year , which is due to the strong performance of our core wholesale and retail energy businesses and our natural gas pipelines . in addition , we also announced that we are on track for our earnings target of $ 0 . 45 for the fourth quarter ( $ 1 . 80 for 2001 ) and $ 2 . 15 for 2002 . we made a commitment to you that we would provide you with timely information about enron ' s business strategy and performance , so this email is intended to provide an explanation about our earnings this quarter . over the past few months , we have met with analysts to discuss enron ' s performance . we received considerable feedback from investors and analysts that we needed to expand our financial reporting to include details for more of our business units . in response to that feedback , we have provided results separately for several of our business units . for example , while we have provided volume figures for north america and europe , this is the first quarter we have provided financials separately for enron americas and for europe and other commodities . in addition , information about our global assets had previously been included in our numbers for wholesale services . this quarter they are reported separately . finally , even though our broadband business is now part of enron wholesale services , we are continuing to report that business separately . following are the highlights of our businesses : wholesale services : total income before interest , minority interests and taxes ( ibit ) increased 28 % to $ 754 million in the third quarter . total wholesale physical volumes increased 65 % to 88 . 2 trillion british thermal units equivalent per day ( tbtue / d ) . americas : ibit increased 31 % to $ 701 million . natural gas volumes increased 6 % to 26 . 7 tbtu / d , and power volumes increased 77 % to 290 million megawatt hours ( mwh ) . europe and other commodity markets : ibit remained unchanged at $ 53 million as compared to last year . while physical gas and power volumes increased , low volatility in these markets caused profitability to remain flat . retail services : enron energy services reported ibit of $ 71 million , compared to $ 27 million a year ago . so far this year , ees has completed more than 50 transactions with large customers and more than 95 , 000 deals with small business customers . transportation and distribution : natural gas pipelines : ibit increased slightly to $ 85 million in the third quarter . portland general : we reported an ibit loss of $ ( 17 ) million this quarter compared to ibit of $ 74 million a year ago . this loss is due to power contracts pge entered into at prices that were significantly higher than actual settled prices during the third quarter . last week , we announced an agreement to sell pge to northwest natural . this transaction is expected to close next year . global assets : this segment includes elektro , dabhol , tgs , azurix and enron wind . third quarter ibit remained unchanged at $ 19 million compared to last year . broadband services : ibit losses were $ ( 80 ) million in the current quarter compared to a $ ( 20 ) million loss last year . this quarter ' s results include significantly lower investment - related income and lower operating costs . corporate and other : this segment includes the unallocated expenses associated with general corporate functions . this segment reported an ibit loss of $ ( 59 ) million compared to $ ( 106 ) million a year ago . in addition , this quarter we announced one - time charges of $ 1 . 01 billion . over the past few quarters , we have conducted a thorough review of our businesses and have decided to take certain charges to clear away issues that have clouded the performance and earnings potential of our core businesses . these charges include : ? a $ 287 million write - down of azurix corp . ? $ 183 million associated with the restructuring of broadband services . this includes severance costs , a loss on the sale of inventory like servers and routers , and a write - down of the value of our content services contracts due to the bankruptcy of a number of customers . ? $ 544 million related to losses from certain investments , primarily enron ' s interest in the new power company , broadband and technology investments and early termination of a structured finance arrangement . with our announcements this quarter we accomplished three things : 1 ) we showed continued strong earnings and earnings growth in our core businesses , 2 ) we cleared away those things that were clouding this superb performance in our core businesses , and 3 ) we expanded our reporting of financial results to increase transparency for our investors . to read the full earnings press release , go to www . enron . com / corp / pressroom / releases .

Subject: template for pricing the right of first refusal shelley and chris , i have set up a template for pricing rofrs . the rofr is priced as a series forward start options . a forward start option gives the holder the right to exercise the option but the strike price is set at the money in future before the option expiration . the feature mimics the " matching the best bid " in the rofr . the underlying for the option is the " best bid " , which should be closely related to the price differential between the two hubs that the pipeline connects . therefore the rofr is case dependent , as vince pointed out . the volatility can be estimated from the " best bid " price history . with these inputs we can estimate the value of rofr . if you have any questions concerning the model please feel free to call me or vince . zimin lu

Subject: possible temporary move of hpl to 1201 louisiana i finished the walk through of the 15 th floor space located at 1201 louisiana this afternoon . on the walk through with me were paul foust ( facilities ) , robert humlicek , jeffrey vincent and andrew hawthorn . i previously talked with deborah bubenko and vincent fox about this space . comments from the review are as follows : most of the floor is composed of offices with some large group areas ( conference rooms etc . ) included . the floor can accommodate up to 150 people . however , with this amount of people in the area , space will be very tight . almost all offices will need to hold at least two people . large offices will need to hold three or four . the larger areas will need to have cubicles installed to make complete use of the space . with maximum doubling up in the offices , you might fit a couple of conference rooms on the floor with one kitchen area . there are nooks just off some of the hallways that would accommodate several network printers . as tommy stated in his earlier e - mail on the allen center space , the fire code will require us to put a strobe in each office with multiple occupants . one area of concern is the amount of furniture currently on the floor . the floor plan shows approximately 90 desks on the floor . some offices were locked so we could not verify the total . however , this number appears correct . also , for the most part , there were only desks in the offices unless they were occupied . chairs , filing cabinets , credenzas , etc . would needed to be added to this space . we need to determine where the additional furniture will come from . there is one large area with 11 cubicles forming a circle . according to paul , this was the area where telephones were answered for the previous tenant . this might work for the trading area . the room appears to have the most telephone connectivity , is open , and would accommodate up to 11 . if we decide trader telephones are necessary ( record conversations etc . ) , the cost associated with the purchase of the equipment and the necessary installation time will need to be factored into our schedule . the floor has two data closets . at least one of the closets has 24 hour air conditioning according to vincent . this floor has the same server connectivity at the three allen center space . a 100 meg single mode fiber connection serves this space . robert has informed me that the floor currently has switches to support up to 200 ports . however , this does not mean that the drops to all offices are complete . probably some cabling will need to be added . it appears that the space can accommodate up to 150 users even with the extra ports needed for network printers , laptops , etc . however , if we need to accommodate more than 200 ports , additional switches can be added . in summary , the floor space at 1201 louisiana looks as good or better than the space that was being considered at three allen center . russell s . long enron net works , llc russell . long @ enron . com ( 713 ) 345 - 3754

Subject: california update 6 / 21 / 01 executive summary ? dwr contracts being negotiated ? california legislature comment on plan b long term contracts sources report that the state ' s lawyers are currently examining how to break the recently negotiated long term power contracts . assemblyman fred keeley has directed his staff to go through and look for any loopholes and sources also believe that the state is looking for ways to " hold the generators to the contracts they want to keep , but break those contracts that they want to break . " sources gathered the following information on plan b through private interviews with california legislatures sen . john burton and assembly speaker robert hertzberg . speaker robert hertzberg : ? speaker hertzberg has spent most of his time lately on the budget , but continues to make efforts related to the plan b . hertzberg is very aware how unlikely it is that he will succeed in putting any plan through the legislature , particularly the senate . ( he believes it will be possible to put a plan b through the assembly ) . ? hertzberg is personally committed to at least attempting to put a plan b through the legislature . this is because he is close to business and wants to see socal saved . he " wants a win under his belt before he leaves the senate next year " so that he can take that win into whatever he does next . davis has laid the burden of bailing out socal on hertzberg . hertzberg is determined to put a piece of legislation on the floor . however , he does not , at this time , know when this will happen , nor does he know what the share of the dedicated rate component will be for businesses and ratepayers , which remains a key sticking point . ? when asked about plan b ' s chances of passing the senate , hertzberg responded that , " miracles can happen . " ? hertzberg defended his idea of setting aside a trust as part of plan b for the generators to litigate over . he stated that his bankruptcy attorney believes that it will work , despite what goode ( the governor ' s attorney ) has said . sen . john burton : ? burton is aware that hertzberg is trying to put together plan b legislation and when asked about hertzberg ' s efforts , burton stated that in the senate " plan b has no republican votes , and there are , at a minimum , 6 democrats that will vote against it . " burton said that for a plan b bailout to pass the senate , it would have to have three elements : ? businesses would pay the entire dedicated rate component . ? the edison parent company would have to give the state $ 1 b . ? all creditors would have to take a 30 % haircut . ? burton wants senator bowen to hold hearings on the plan b that will run for at least 3 days , then have a " long caucus . " at that point the senate will either " hold an up - or - down vote on whatever comes from the assembly or add amendments [ stating the three provisions above ] . " burton wants " all senators to know exactly what they ' re voting for or against . " ? burton stated that he would " bet against " a plan b passing . " this is not gonna happen , " he stated . burton believes that a bailout deal would be bad for the democratic party .

( of course , because of the $ 15 , 000 / year limit , i have to spread my gifts over several years in order to get the total amount matched by enron . ) sherry benton , the librarian in spearman just called and gave me the great news that the $ 20 , 000 in community donations has been achieved . in fact , i expect that the total community number will come to almost $ 25 , 000 once all of the donations are received . in order to recognize our part in all this , the mayor of the town is planning to declare october 17 th as " stinson gibner and enron day " in spearman , and they would like to have some public ceremony to bestow this recognition . there will be coverage by the local radio station and newspaper and , possibly , by the amarillo newspaper as well . they are asking if a representative from enron ( other than myself ) would be interested in coming to spearman for this event . please let me know if you or anyone else would be interested in doing this . spearman is about a 90 minute drive north from the airport in amarillo , and it is possible to get there and back to houston on the same day . thanks , stinson gibner x 34748 p . s . is there any possibility of getting a one time raise on the $ 15 , 000 / year matching cap so that i can have $ 40 , 000 matched in just two years instead of three ? - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - forwarded by stinson gibner / hou / ect on 09 / 20 / 2000 02 : 01 pm - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - stinson gibner 05 / 05 / 2000 11 : 47 am to : cindy olson / corp / enron @ enron cc : subject : thanks cindy , i just received notification of enron ' s match of my $ 8000 donation to the hansford county library in spearman , texas . ( all old pipeline hands know spearman because both northern natural and transwestern pipelines run near by the city . ) you may be interested to know what i am trying to accomplish there . the library is one of the few independent public libraries in the state of texas as it is owned neither by the county nor city . it ' s budget is met through a combination of city , county , and private contributions . a big part of their income comes from the " thrift shop , " spearman ' s version of the blue bird circle . in order to help the library continue to provide quality services to the community ( our library in spearman , population 3000 , is by all accounts much better than the one in nearby perryton , population 15000 ) , i am trying to help the library establish an endowment fund . we have set a goal of raising $ 100 , 000 over the next 3 years . with enron ' s matching , i am planning to provide about $ 80 , 000 of that amount with the other $ 20 , 000 coming from contributions from others in the local community . i am also investigating if the library can get any type of matching grant from other foundations , but it looks like most prefer to fund specific projects rather than put funds towards endowments . let me know if you have any suggestions for us . thanks , stinson x 34748

Subject: wholesale and retail power systems about a month ago i held a meeting in houston to bring together the systems , operations , and commercial people who were responsible for designing and building our wholesale and retail systems . there were probably twenty people there , including beth perlman , anthony dayao , beth appollo , bob hall , leslie reeves , lloyd will , todd busby , greg woulfe , rogers herndon , murray o ' neil , steve nat , jeff richter , thresa allen , pablo ? , mark pickering , dale furrow , and many more . two of my suspicions were confirmed in this meeting . first , it was clear that there were a bunch of people working in silos . beth ' s group was just starting to talk to anthony ' s group . the site profile team wasn ' t on the same page as richter who wasn ' t necessarily in sync with herndon . ees and ena ( and for that matter east ena and west ena ) volume management and rto settlements people weren ' t talking to one another . second , it was clear that nobody had tried to map out what all of the necessary functions are and how they should fit together . we tasked todd busby , debra bailey , and lloyd will to spend a month talking to each group and " drawing the picture " of all of the systems that were being worked on and how they should fit together . they brought in a couple of people from accenture to assist with this project . the powerpoint presentation below documents their findings . i would encourage you to look at pages 11 through 15 which summarize the issues and recommendations . here are the highlights : power it and operations remain organizationally divided between wholesale and retail settlements development efforts are not global create one power it & one operations organization for retail and wholesale power create power program management team to coordinate business requirements for trading , risk , settlements busby , todd ; richter , jeff subject : version 5 - small tweaks only ( not required ) tim , i made the following changes to the presentation which are not required for your distribution if you have already sent it out : 1 . page 10 first bullet - changed " one power and operations organization " to " one power and one operations organization " . 2 . page 11 - modified colors to clarify point debra
Subject: california update ca power market awaits bailout california power watchers were hoping for results early this week from the marathon government - industry negotiations . the principals of last tuesday night ' s marathon session were expected to meet by video - conference over the weekend to review solutions developed by staff working groups , which met through the end of the week . ( see daily gpi , jan . 11 ) on the west coast the week ended with emergency legislation starting its dash through the state capital , and the governor holding a 90 - minute meeting with two neighboring western governors to piece together a regional strategy on joint energy conversation / supply cooperation . on friday gov . gray davis said if ferc fails to act , he is sure congress will take up legislation to stabilize power prices throughout the country , " or at least give governors the option to opt into a stabilized pricing mechanism . sen . diane feinstein , d - ca , announced she was working on a bill to be offered later this month , which would allow the energy secretary to impose price caps . davis indicated that he and federal officials would be working over the weekend and he expects to have something to announce early next week , and in the long term he expects to " solve this problem in the next 90 days and in six months hopefully this whole episode will be a distant memory . " also on friday standard & poor ' s assigned an investment grade triple b - plus corporate credit rating to subsidiary pg & e energy trading holdings , and said subsidiaries gas transmission northwest and pe & g generating also would maintain their investment grade rating , based on each entity ' s own creditworthiness and economic self - sufficiency . these units would be insulated from any downgrades of the parent pg & e corp . , or the utility subsidiary , pacific gas & electric . this action came after pg & e suspended its fourth quarter dividend and announced it was cutting staff and services ( see daily gpi , jan . 12 ) . following their meeting in sacramento friday , gov . davis and his counterparts in oregon , john kitzhaber , and washington , gary locke , announced a feb . 2 western governors ' meeting would be held in portland , or , to push for a western region wholesale power price cap , and a region - wide push by each state to conserve energy and finally to share energy supplies on a seasonal basis . as fellow democrats , washington ' s gov . locke and oregon ' s gov . kitzhaber expressed strong support for gov . davis ' s efforts and pushed for solutions from ferc " it is extraordinarily important that this not be a partisan struggle between west coast democratic governors and the inland governors who are mostly republican , " said kitzhaber , noting that not all the solutions have to come from new generation . conservation can play a major role , too . both visiting governors said they strongly support the state of california becoming the purchaser of long - term power and then reselling to the utilities . they are banking on the fact that the state ' s creditworthiness will gain much better prices than the cash - strapped , near - bankrupt two major utilities , southern california edison co . and pacific gas and electric co . the lower house ( assembly ) of the state legislature cranked out about a dozen proposed laws , including one to completely restructure the oversight boards of the state - chartered grid operator ( cal - iso ) and wholesale spot power market ( cal - px ) from large stakeholder panels of 26 to 30 industry representatives to small units of three people each - - - all appointed by the governor . another proposed law would prevent the state ' s three major private - sector utilities , including the two near bankruptcy , to sell their remaining generation units , which are comprised mostly of nuclear , hydroelectric and interests in out - of - state coal - fired plants . gov . davis indicated he expects state lawmakers to pass the bill this wednesday , establishing three - person boards , and the members of the iso panel will be the head of the state ' s three principal agencies overseeing electricity - - - the california public utilities commission , california energy commission and electricity oversight board , of which two of the three are headed by davis appointees . the near - rolling blackouts of thursday , caused by storm - driven wave surges that curtailed power production at coastal plants , were eliminated over the weekend through stepped up conservation , restoration of major units at pg & e ' s diablo canyon nuclear generating plant , and by what the grid operator called " the biggest single - day " lowering of demand he has ever experienced . this week cal - iso expects to have 5 , 000 to 6 , 000 mw that were out of service last week back online , further improving the chance of avoiding power emergencies . salvaging the state ' s system last week at the critical stage three was california ' s water resources department , which operates the massive north - to - south network of aqueducts . it purchased 1 , 200 mw from out of state using the state ' s creditworthiness to get around the cal - iso financial problems . as it has done on a lower - profile basis in the past , the water resources department acted as a quasi - state power authority , and the cal - iso coo kellan fluckiger said that other market participants also are providing this sort of " intermediary financing " in light of the credit concerns surrounding the iso and utilities . the water department also contributed to the supply crunch - - - as it does routinely - - - by shutting down its heavy electricity consuming pumps that move massive quantities of water around the state . - -
Subject: unresolved issues for jan 1 . i think everyone agrees that there was a lot of confusion in desk assignments and responsibilities . with that said , i am listing some of the current issues that i have seen , that will need to be addressed quickly . most of these issues are none of my business , but since i see unpathed gas i thought you two might want to dicsuss these issues . enron field services - has not been nominated since september 99 . have we stopped doing business on this pipe ? ( just an fyi - ? ) do we need to get this assigned ? i can find old notes and try to get this pathed if necessary . someone just needs to let me know . lavaca expense transport - this is offsystem gas that hplc transports for ena . ena has no nom at meter 1000 in pops for jan 1 . midcon texas pipeline - there were deals left unpathed for jan 1 ( and dec ? ) . i brokered and nominated the obvious but we seem to have 10 , 000 with transport contract to move this gas on and no sale to broker to . as it stands , it looks like we have a long position . who is this assigned to ? i thought carlos was handling this one , but i could be wrong . channel industries pipeline - several issues here : 1 . all deals with the exception of the long term transport expense were left unpathed for jan 1 . i viewed prior month transactions and pathed appropriately . someone needs to review for accuracy . also , there were deals that went to zero , that were nominated for january . 2 . we still do not have enough supply to meet our sales requirement . this issue has been left unsresolved since october 99 . volume management cannot allocate was is not pathed and nominated . 3 . there is a transaction for january that is once again not on our point specific transport contracts .

Subject: rumor that the legislature may reconvene bizarre as it sounds , we ' ve now heard that they are calling the assembly members back . so it appears that the assembly leadership will at least make a run at this . we are getting more information and mobilizing industry . some key considerations : the governor is putting immense pressure on the legislature to get something done . the legislature is fearful of getting blamed by the governor for having " done nothing . " becauase the assembly has thus far " done nothing , " the only thing it has in front of it is 78 . the assembly could not agree to the speaker ' s bill because it felt the bill was too far to the left ; but 78 is even more one - sided . so there ' s a reasonable likelihood that 78 would have to be amended considerably in order to get the support necessary to get voted out . once voted out of the assembly , it would have to go back to the senate , where the senate would have to approve it . again , the senate has adjourned , so burton would have to round them up and call them back for a vote , and there ' s no indication at this time that burton ' s inclined to come back . in addition , burton has said that he ' s not interested in making any changes to 78 , that " it ' s 78 or nothing . " consequently , for the sentate ( i . e . , burton ) to vote it out , it would first have to agree to the assembly ' s amendments . thus far , the assembly and the senate have not seen eye to eye on the issues . all that said , this legislature is far from rational , and nothing can be counted out . we ' re therefore operating under the assumption that 78 could move . will report back as information becomes available . best , jeff " scott govenar " 07 / 24 / 2001 05 : 15 pm please respond to sgovenar to : " ban sharma " , " david leboe " , " eric letke " , " jennifer thome " , " ken smith " , " bev hansen " , " hedy govenar " , " miyung buster " , " janel guerrero " , " robert frank " , " mike day " , " leslie lawner " , " harry . kingerski @ enron . com " , " karen denne " , " steven kean " , " alan comnes " , " susan j mara " , " paul kaufman " , " jeff dasovich " , " jim steffes " , " rick shapiro " cc : subject : assembly session - urgent the assembly is tentatively scheduled to take up sbx 2 78 in committee on friday . if the bill passes , it may go straight to the assembly floor that night . the senate may go in either late friday or early monday to take up the bill as amended although this has not been confirmed . amendments to sbx 78 may be available tomorrow .

" all things that are happening to the margin , whether it be california , 9 - 11 ( the sept . 11 attacks ) , or enron , will tend to slow down changes that have gone down that path , " derrick said after addressing an energy department conference here on coal technology . derrick was optimistic about the future of deregulation . " where it already exists , it ' s working , and i think we ' ll stay the course , " he said . to boost customer choice , 23 states and the district columbia have deregulated retail electricity markets . deregulation breaks up utility monopolies , giving customers a choice of providers and driving down prices . electricity competition is set to begin in texas , illinois , michigan , and virginia next year . derrick said state deregulation efforts will pick up momentum if consumers demand more choice and lower prices . " people who ( live in a market that is deregulated ) , and move to a place where it doesn ' t exist , are going to say ' gee , why can ' t i have it here ' , " derrick said . " customers are going to start to demand choice , " he added . pepco is part of the pennsylvania , new jersey , maryland ( pjm ) power pool , which operates the electricity grid in the mid - atlantic region . pjm , which currently coordinates a pooled generating capacity of more than 59 , 000 megawatts , plans to expand generating capacity by 25 percent in the next few years to meet demand . pjm also operates a wholesale electricity market with more than 200 buyers , sellers and traders . california dealt the first blow to electricity deregulation last year , when state power prices soared , bankrupting pg & e corp . ' s pacific gas & electric unit , and forcing rolling blackouts to some customers . experts have blamed the california power crisis on the state ' s ill - fated deregulation plan , which prohibited utilities from passing on wholesale price increases to consumers . the decline of enron may slow restructuring because uncertain customers will stick with existing power suppliers rather than seek new energy providers . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . lawmaker / andersen - 2 : co ' confident ' about quality 11 / 19 / 2001 dow jones news service ( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones 202 - 862 - 6692 ; judith . burns @ dowjones . com copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . some pension funds consider legal action against enron by christiane bird 11 / 19 / 2001 dow jones business news ( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones & company , inc . ) dow jones newswires new york - - some pension funds with major stakes in enron corp . are considering taking legal action against the houston energy giant following its recent stock collapse and disclosures of possible conflicts of interest among management . other institutional investors are taking a more passive approach , waiting to see how developments unfold . among those pension funds looking into possible lawsuits are the $ 112 billion new york state common retirement fund and the five new york city pension funds , which handle a total of $ 85 billion in assets for the city ' s firefighters , police , teachers and other workers . the state fund holds about 2 . 1 million enron ( ene ) shares and the city funds hold about 2 . 9 million . " we ' re looking at a possible lawsuit , but we ' re not leaning one way or another , " said frank sobrino , spokesman for the new york state common retirement fund . " we ' re looking into [ possible legal action ] , but nothing ' s been decided yet , " said david neustadt , spokesman for the new york city comptroller ' s office , which oversees the city ' s five pension funds . barclays global investors , which manages about $ 790 billion , mostly for pension funds and other institutional clients , said it would join others in a class - action suit , but wouldn ' t be the lead plaintiff . barclays is the fourth - largest investor in enron , with about 21 million shares as of sept . 30 . " our style doesn ' t lend itself to taking that lead role , but we would be members of a class suit , " said linda selbach , head of corporate governance . as primarily a passive money manager , barclays invests according to market forces , not according to company information , and so couldn ' t claim to have been misled by false information , she explained . however , " on the macro level , we ' ve been very involved in the shaping of the law with respect to securities litigation , and would be again , " she said . the company would be especially inclined to get involved if the suit promised to set a precedent for other cases further down the line , she said . pension funds among largest enron investors institutional investors such as pension funds , mutual fund companies and money management firms are among the largest investors in enron , once a top - performing company whose stock has plunged 89 % year - to - date and is now the subject of a securities and exchange commission probe into outside partnership deals . several law firms already have sued the company on behalf of shareholders , accusing enron of misleading investors and artificially inflating its share price . last week , the $ 143 billion california public employees ' retirement system , or calpers , issued a release stating their intention to oppose the appointment of any current enron board member to the board of any company with which enron may be contemplating a merger . the statement came following reports that enron might be acquired by smaller rival dynegy inc . ( dyn ) , and that enron was seeking the right to appoint three members to the combined company board . " until all of these issues are sorted out , the interests of shareholders are best served by retirement of all the current directors , " michael flaherman , chair of calpers ' investment committee , said in the statement . however , calpers has no comment regarding possible legal action against enron , spokesman brad pacheco said . calpers owns about three million shares of enron and also invests in dynegy . the $ 105 billion california state teachers retirement system , or calstrs , is " taking a keen interest , and reviewing our holdings and options " regarding enron , said a spokeswoman . the board has made no decisions yet , but plans to discuss the subject in a closed session at the next board meeting , she said . the $ 96 billion florida retirement system , which holds 9 . 7 million enron shares , is " still evaluating the situation , " spokeswoman lee baldwin said .

" the best accounting standards in the world are meaningless if the accounting and audit processes are so inept or corrupt that they produce unreliable numbers and untruthful reporting , " wrote dingell , a michigan democrat , in the letter . " i request that pob ' s investigation or review include adequate , transparent and public disclosure of all significant issues identified , " dingell wrote . as accounting has consolidated into fewer and larger firms with more lines of business from auditing to consulting , it has come under increasing fire on the conflict - of - interest issue . the dingell letter is only the latest in a continuing barrage of criticism leveled in recent years at big five firms . arthur andersen , based in chicago , was auditor to houston energy trading giant enron , rocked in recent weeks by a securities and exchange commission probe of certain outside partnership deals involving company officers . enron ' s stock price has plunged , several managers have resigned and numerous shareholder lawsuits are pending . enron earlier this month said it planned to be bought out by rival dynegy inc . . critics have said arthur andersen should have done more as enron ' s auditor to draw investors ' attention to its unusual finances . a lawsuit filed in oregon alleged arthur andersen ' s judgment was swayed by lucrative consulting fees that it was collecting from enron while it was also being paid as auditor . andersen says confident in process responding to dingell , andersen spokesman david tabolt said accounting firms must report litigation involving allegations of audit failures within 30 days to a committee of the sec ' s practice section , which the public oversight board oversees . " under the profession ' s self - regulatory processes , which the pob oversees , the committee is responsible for conducting an inquiry to determine whether the matters that are the subject of litigation indicate systemic quality control problems that need to be addressed either by the firm involved or by the profession , " tabolt said . " we are confident that this process will confirm the quality of our auditing processes , " he said . after the sec said last month that it was investigating enron , the company appointed a special internal committee to look into the unusual partnership deals at the heart of the probe . deloitte & touche , also a big five accounting firm , was named to assist the committee in its inquiry , enron said . but , according to dingell , deloitte is conducting a triennial peer review of andersen under a system set up in the 1970 s to ensure quality accounting . the peer review process is also supervised by the public oversight board , based in connecticut . neither the board nor deloitte could be reached . dingell said deloitte ' s dual roles as peer reviewer of andersen and as internal investigator of its audit client enron raise further questions of potential conflicts of interest . " given the appearance of conflicts of interest , the public record to date regarding allegations of professional malpractice or worse by andersen in both the waste management fraud and the evolving enron corp . accounting debacle , as well as the considerable damage to investors , there appears to be little reason for the public to have faith in andersen or the peer review process , " wrote dingell , ranking member of the house committee on energy and commerce . in june , arthur andersen was fined $ 7 million by the sec to settle charges that it filed false and misleading audit reports of waste management , a garbage hauling concern , in the largest ever civil penalty against a big five accounting firm . andersen did not admit or deny the charges . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . enron delays closing indian plant after creditors ' legal action 11 / 19 / 2001 afx news ( c ) 2001 by afp - extel news ltd bombay ( afx ) - enron corp ' s indian subsidiary said it had to delay serving a final termination notice to close its power project in western maharashtra state after local creditors filed legal action . the dabhol power company ltd ( dpc ) was originally going to serve the notice to maharashtra state ' s electricity board ( mseb ) after today , when the six - month deadline for resolving a payment dispute ends , an enron official told agence france - presse . now , however , it has to wait until after dec 3 , because indian banks and financial institutions that have lent money to dabhol power recently filed a lawsuit to ensure they get their funds back . " the domestic lenders have gone to the court and secured a stay order against our final notice till their next nearing which is on december 3 , " an enron official said . " we are working on a strategy to help resolve the issue as soon as possible , but obviously can ' t disclose it now . " the lawsuit was filed by the state bank of india , icici ltd , the industrial development bank of india and ifci ltd . the enron official said the bankers have gone to court demanding an immediate resumption of work at the plant to ensure cash flow and to help the owners repay money owed to the lenders . jds / cmr / jsa for more information and to contact afx : www . afxnews . com and www . afxpress . com copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . usa company - enron ' s trials have just begun . 11 / 19 / 2001 eiu viewswire ( c ) 2001 the economist intelligence unit limited . all rights reserved . country briefing from the economist new york : lawyers are swarming all over enron ' s old financial statements and press releases in the hope of reaping huge fees from securities litigation . more than 20 class - action lawsuits have been filed in recent weeks , and new ones are popping up every day . a formal process has been started to consolidate litigation in houston , where the troubled energy company is based , with all lawyers interested in the case required to stake their claims by december 21 st . the broadest accusations will be of fraud and material misstatement , legal ways of saying that the company ' s financial statements were garbage . this week , enron ' s founder and chairman , kenneth lay , decided to forgo a severance package worth over $ 60 m while admitting that the company ' s problems " had been exacerbated by the extensive use of debt capital , both on and off the balance sheet " . america ' s financial accounting standards board ( fasb ) is looking again at off - balance - sheet financing , having fretted about it on and off for a decade . there will also be charges of insider trading , because even as enron was issuing securities amid glowing profits reports , top executives were dumping over $ 1 billion of enron shares to " unsuspecting investors " , a group that includes anybody who , however briefly , has held one of the company ' s 750 m shares in the past two years . " the number of class members will be huge , " says maurice pesso , a lawyer at a new york firm that has filed a claim . there are , however , limits to the company ' s liability . it has already restated its results going back five years , but federal law restricts litigation to the past three . moreover , enron will not take the rap alone . its auditor , arthur andersen ( now plain andersen ) , is also named as a defendant in at least one of the complaints already filed . the litigation comes after a rough decade for andersen . it has had to pay hundreds of millions of dollars in settlements after sloppy audits on such companies as waste management , sunbeam and discovery zone . because enron evolved from an energy company into a financial firm , it became much like an unregulated bank . the lack of supervision meant that the role of the company ' s auditor was crucial . andersen was certainly paid as if it was . in 2000 , it collected $ 25 m for auditing enron ' s books and another $ 27 m for consulting services . now how do you account for that ? source : the economist . copyright ? 2000 dow jones another $ 500 million to $ 1 billion in private equity that lay said was in negotiations last week ; and the success of a planned $ 800 million sale of assets by year ' s end ) . the $ 1 . 75 billion loan is part of a $ 3 billion revolving facility , also led by jp morgan chase and citibank / ssb , that was drawn down in october to pay off about $ 1 . 8 billion in commercial paper obligations and calm the market ' s concerns about enron ' s liquidity . the facility also includes a $ 1 . 25 billion portion that matures in 2005 . " one of the big credit issues from a corporate standpoint is enron ' s ability to renew the 364 - day facility that matures in 2002 , " said ralph pellechia , a credit analyst at fitch . the lead banks declined to comment on the ongoing loan discussions , which include the already agreed to $ 1 billion facility that is secured by enron pipeline assets , and other bankers in the close - knit loan syndication community admitted to being in the dark . it is likely , though , that the discussions have included an attempt to address bankers ' concerns about the loan maturing in five months , pellecchia said . " i think that in conjunction with the new $ 1 billion loan , they are attempting to address the revolver , " pellecchia said . the $ 1 billion loan , hammered out in late october , was expected to be syndicated among a small , select group of lenders . incorporating the maturing revolver into the current solution would likely bring in a wider circle of banks , one banker said , noting that " just about everybody was in that [ existing ] deal . " jpm / citi must save enron however the financing unfolds , arrangers jp morgan chase and citibank / ssb ' s tight control of the deal reflects the banks ' urgency in aiding a major corporate client to which they have a broad range of business exposure . that exposure extends beyond corporate loans to credit derivatives and short - term loans financing the company ' s myriad energy trading - related transactions . " [ jp morgan and citi ] have the most to gain but also the most to lose with respect to enron , " said one rival banker , adding that the banks ' rapid response to enron ' s deteriorating situation reflected the importance of those relationships . " i was amazed how quickly that [ $ 1 billion ] deal came together , and how enron - which never did anything secured - pledged its most valuable [ pipeline ] assets . " the $ 1 billion loan is secured by enron ' s trans western and northern natural gas pipeline systems , the latter of which is also pledged to dynegy for its $ 1 . 5 billion investment . " from a risk standpoint , it ' s probably the best peace of enron paper that chase and citi have - it ' s the only secured stuff out there , " said one banker . but despite the impressive collateral , the $ 1 billion loan was priced attractively at 250 basis points over libor , he said . " i think it ' s a comment on how bad the news was . enron ' s going to have to put up one of its major jewels for a $ 1 billion credit at libor plus 250 . " in addition to playing major roles in financing enron ' s off - balance sheet ventures , such as the dahbol power project in india , jp morgan chase and citibank / ssb have also been major players in the company ' s complicated financing initiatives . for example , citibank / ssb runs enron ' s yosemite credit - linked note program and , along with jp morgan chase , is active in other enron - related credit derivative business . a recent research report by goldman sachs noted that the one - stop shop concept closely tied the banks to enron and has also made them crucial in these trying times . " the two banks most involved with enron in terms of magnitude of credit / derivatives exposure , citi and jp morgan , were also obviously involved in selling the company , with each acting as a financial advisor in the sale , " the report stated . " the banks were critical ( given enron ' s liquidity needs and the related high risk to further rating agency downgrades ) and likely influential to the outcome reached to sell the company as a means to sustain the operations of enron and protect all creditors involved . consequently , in a way , this is another win for the bank / broker model , " the report says . in a separate report , goldman ' s fixed income power analyst , robert rubin , said that despite enron ' s questionable business practices bringing it close to the brink , a merger that maintains its core energy market - making operations is preferable to leaving a vacuum in that arena . he added that despite concerns raised by the ratings agencies and other parties , goldman believes the merger will close . " the balance sheet of a combined company could be strong , if enron completes its asset sales , " fitch ' s pellecchia said . " but there are still a lot of moving pieces .

" how comfortable would you feel signing a fixed - price deal with a company with no assets of its own to produce your gas or generate your power , and whose ability to obtain those supplies via futures or swaps was eroded because its credit was on the verge of being downgraded to junk ? " an energy banker asked . this could have favored the long side of the market in normal circumstances , consumers such as utilities could almost have stayed out of the november bid week cash market , backed as they were by huge storage and warm weather . instead they must have bought heavily , perhaps fearing that with enron sick there wouldn ' t be enough counterparty weight to take the other side and supply them later if they stayed short . the fear could have been that over the counter swaps to hedge later spot purchases might just not be available on enron online the way they usually are . other traders might not have been able to take up the slack , since they trade often with enron . commercial players might have perceived them as being infected with some of the same weakness . after the dynegy deal was announced , however , prices could have been freed to fall back to where they were at the end of september , with users now unafraid to play the short side because enron was back in business with a better credit rating . by nov . 14 , with cash prices more than $ 1 below where they were during bid week , enron spokesman eric thode said , " volumes on enron online have returned to the normal range . the 30 - day moving average has improved to a more normal 5 , 700 transactions per day with a notional value of $ 1 . 7 billion . " even allowing for some exaggeration by enron ' s pr man to instill market confidence , that points to a correlation of falling prices and a revived enron . they don ' t speak german at enron , do they ? if so , what happened to gas prices last month could have been the mirror image of the metallgesellschaft ag - induced crisis on the oil futures market in early 1994 . that crisis pushed oil prices down instead of shoving gas prices up . this german firm , a trader and user of oil , had used a very aggressive strategy to obtain its supplies of oil . in order to lock in a price for the coming year , the germans " stacked " all their contracts covering their oil needs for the coming year as long positions on the near month . they would go to delivery on just the portion they needed for the next four weeks , then would " roll " the rest of the contracts onto the next futures month . they did that by selling the remainder of the expiring month ' s contracts and using the money to buy the same number of the next month ' s contracts . but to be sure of being able to do that without losing their lederhosen , the germans had to be sure that the next month ' s contracts would be cheaper than the prompt month ones they had just sold . well , due to last minute purchases by consumers going to delivery , the prompt month usually is higher than the next one . so the germans thought they had a strategy that would guarantee them a profit every month when they flipped their futures stack , a nice kicker on top of having locked in the underlying cost of the oil they would use for the year . yeah , right . well , one month that didn ' t happen , mostly because other traders got wind of what the germans were doing and decided to hold their feet to the fire by bidding up the next month ( which is a variant of what happened to long term capital management four years later . ) so , losing another battle of the bulge , this time to nymex traders instead of to general patton , metallgesellschaft cratered . as a trustee unwound the train wreck of long futures , he went on a selling spree that kept the nymex price low for months . ngl price boxscore data from altrade ( tm ) ngl indexes mtd averages in italics mont belvieu tx eth pro norm iso pen + ngl bbl nov 8 - 14 , ' 01 22 . 53 35 . 45 41 . 44 39 . 36 45 . 34 $ 13 . 99 nov 1 - 7 , ' 01 23 . 85 35 . 91 41 . 24 40 . 38 45 . 5 $ 14 . 28 oct 25 - 31 , ' 01 24 . 63 39 . 22 43 . 74 43 . 15 # # # $ 15 . 30 oct 18 - 24 , ' 01 23 . 95 39 . 27 43 . 96 43 . 34 47 . 84 $ 15 . 07 oct ' 01 24 . 05 39 . 44 45 . 06 44 . 44 50 $ 15 . 34 sept ' 01 25 . 62 42 . 4 52 . 65 51 . 8 59 . 68 $ 17 . 19 3 rd qtr ' 01 26 . 55 41 . 12 49 . 94 49 . 7 56 . 31 $ 16 . 75 2 nd qtr ' 01 36 . 27 49 . 57 55 . 22 64 . 89 64 . 68 $ 20 . 50 3 rd qtr ' 00 39 59 . 39 66 . 99 66 . 35 75 . 29 $ 23 . 47 nov 9 - 15 , ' 00 43 . 46 61 . 35 73 . 24 72 . 02 82 . 94 $ 25 . 39 conway ks : group 140 nov 8 - 14 , ' 01 21 . 08 37 . 67 37 . 13 41 . 5 44 . 16 $ 13 . 78 nov 1 - 7 , ' 01 22 . 57 40 . 69 38 . 5 43 . 68 43 . 78 $ 14 . 48 oct 25 - 31 , ' 01 22 . 21 44 . 22 39 . 86 48 . 5 49 . 21 $ 15 . 41 oct 18 - 24 , ' 01 21 . 72 44 . 74 40 . 84 47 . 17 50 . 44 $ 15 . 50 oct ' 01 21 . 7 44 . 21 39 . 63 46 . 37 54 . 04 $ 15 . 59 sept ' 01 21 . 83 46 . 97 44 . 93 51 . 87 78 . 11 $ 18 . 00 3 rd qtr ' 01 23 . 86 45 . 33 44 . 72 52 . 77 74 . 4 $ 17 . 88 2 nd qtr ' 01 32 . 27 54 . 15 53 . 99 76 . 12 76 . 01 $ 21 . 44 3 rd qtr ' 00 37 . 11 63 . 91 65 . 8 67 . 48 78 . 9 $ 23 . 93 nov 9 - 15 , ' 00 42 . 26 62 . 63 73 . 27 74 . 8 83 $ 25 . 43 individual product prices in cents per gallon . ngl barrel : dollars per 42 gallons . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . u . s .

' s water unit , may have to sell assets if it can ' t find financing to continue operations , the company said in a regulatory filing . enron took azurix public in june 1999 and then , after the water company ' s stock plunged , took it private and paid off investors in march . azurix isn ' t sure it will be able to renew or refinance about $ 113 . 3 million in long - term debt , including bank loans , that matures before sept . 30 at a ` ` reasonable ' ' cost , it said in a filing with the u . s . securities and exchange commission . the company also had $ 326 . 3 million in short - term debt as of sept . 30 . the loans are azurix ' s ` ` primary sources of liquidity , ' ' the filing said . if the company can ' t raise the funds , it might have to use the proceeds from planned asset sales to refinance debt and get cash , the filing said . if those asset sales don ' t generate enough money , ` ` azurix may need to sell other assets , which could result in azurix incurring losses in future periods , ' ' the company said . azurix , though it still must file with the sec , no longer trades as a separate stock . the shares of houston - based enron fell 8 cents to $ 8 . 92 in early afternoon trading . enron agreed earlier this month to be acquired by rival dynegy inc . in a transaction currently valued at $ 24 . 9 billion . the buyout came after enron ' s shares plunged amid an sec investigation of the company ' s dealings with affiliated partnerships .

Subject: hotlist and upstream products update - confidential dear louise , congratulations on your baby boy ! i hope the delivery was not too painful and please don ' t be upset with him since he wanted to share your birthday . happy belated 32 ! anyhow , on to business . needless to say , a lot has happened which is why this email is tardy . i apologize , but somehow i think your time has been occupied as well . the following has happened : ? john nowlan is dragging his feet on payment of the $ 1 . 25 in origination due to upstream products for the formosa transaction . ? i will cc : you on an email which will be my response to mr . goodpasture ' s assertion that ecf does not need to grant any origination for the storage contract negotiated on their behalf by chris hilgert and mike bilberry . goodpasture believes they will be " appropriately recognized thru the prc process . " in addition , he seems to think , incorrectly , that the overall value of the transaction was worth $ 50 million . perhaps i should show him my p & l . ? i am having a conference call with redmond and hart to resolve the bilberry title issue . ? i feel that delainey and dietrich are trying to shut down ecs within upstream products . i can not get any resources dedicated to price out the compression deals that i need to close . based on their lack of " capacity " as well as their prioritization queue ( i ' m at the bottom ) , i am being told by janet to negotiate with coops , munis , and other regulatory affiliates for generation , t & d , and site profile pricing . my intuition tells me that greg sharp is behind this directive and is influencing janet ' s perspective . ( when is was a v . p . of hpl , greg sharp had the compression group report to him and was led by mark courtney - also at ees . ) as an aside , i am very disappointed by the bureaucracy of this entire process . i have tried to be very flexible and at the same time , build a third party compression business . i understand that their are significant resource and pricing issues , but i need human capital dedicated to getting these deals done internally . the compression business is not pure retail nor is it pure wholesale . but i believe , that it is a commercial group that could provide significant p & l if given appropriate resources . i will be meeting with john lavorato today to discuss these issues . ? on monday , i presented to the corporate culture committee a report which highlighted some eoy 2000 prc statistics that globally represented enron . michelle cash had a hissy that i had access to this information and cindy olson had to step in and approve my access . in fact , i have attached the presentation given , but at the meeting , i picked up all the copies and shredded them . please be very careful with this file . i am meeting with michelle cash and human relations to be aware of all legal ramifications for any further prc / management research by business unit . in addition , i met with billy lemmons and we are going to set up two small focus groups ( 10 employees each ) comprised of associates and analysts , who rated at least " strong " from the 2000 prc process . i would like to target some general management and meritocracy issues and get verbal feedback . i would like to present my findings to the corporate culture committee on june 6 . ? the attached hotlist file also has an " executive sheet . " this sheet represents any residual origination positions from last year that are under my responsibility . in addition , for the hotlist file , each business unit sheet has their p & l represented . this p & l combines accrual as well as mkt - to - mkt margin . this number will be different from the management report since that file represents accrual margin or " flashes " for the entire quarter . i am only representing " actualized " p & l thru april . i do not know how you would like to represent bhlp . i am making the following recommendation : ytd 2001 forecast in 000 s ( 10 , 829 ) ytd 2001 plan in 000 s ( 13 , 490 ) assumes a $ 56 million ebitda . bhlp ebit variance $ 2 , 661 in addition , i could represent a quarterly representation as well . ? other issues : i am also meeting with lavorato to get the var for the wellhead desk raised above 100 k to 1 million . when trying to represent the p & l for the hotlist , i realized that it was inaccurate ( i . e . , ats warrants value incorrectly as well as other issues ) and i think now it is fairly clean . i have started re - scrubbing bhlp p & l . the storage monetization structure is getting interesting . turns out the ets ( northern ) took significant earnings to the bottom line by monetizing their base gas and did not want us to meet with the ferc regarding our structure . ( the biggest concern of our customer list is regulatory - we wanted the ferc to " advise " us . it was steffes ' idea . ) however , we did find out that skadden arps wrote northern an opinion letter indemnifying them of potential regulatory risk . sorry for the book , best regards , mrha

Subject: ena gas structuring in addition to my current role of leading ena ' s wholesale gas structuring , i have been asked to take on ena ' s retail gas structuring for ees . i have asked mark breese to take the lead on all ees related activity effective immediately . mark will maintain a lead role on a couple of important wholesale transactions that are ongoing , but he will not be taking on any new wholesale deals . eric moon will retain his lead role on all west region deals and will take the lead on all new east region deals . eric boyt will retain his lead role for all upstream and ecr deals , and will back up eric moon on new east region deals as needed . santiago garcia ( associate ) has chosen to stay in gas structuring for his third rotation to contribute his needed experience to the team . finally , several associates and analysts are being added to gas structuring to handle increased wholesale deal flow and the ees effort . mark breese , melissa solis and i have moved to the 14 th floor and we will office at the following locations : mark breese eb - 1457 a ed mcmichael eb - 1456 c melissa solis eb - 1456 d we are moving to the 14 th floor to initially be closer to the ees business as well as free up space on the 32 nd floor . this move is temporary as all gas structuring ( wholesale and retail ) will be located together on the 6 th floor in the new building .

Subject: update : ffvols ted , an update on the implementation for ffvols : ( 1 ) in comparing 6 days of historical var calculations ( with that of the implied ) for agg - gas , we have found that the historical var calculations are consistently lower over this period , by roughly 17 mm . the implied volatilities are much higher at this period , anticipating strong winter prices . ( 2 ) at this time , the consensus is not to relase the historical implementation into production , and the official line to traders will be that the method is still in testing . the historical var is 19 . 2 mm and the implied is 37 mm for effective date of 09 / 25 . ( 3 ) further testing is in progress on a hybrid methodology ( which i mentioned last week , whereby historical vols are scaled by the ratio of prompt to historical - prompt volatilities ) , to atleast capture some implied / forward effects . tanya ' s analysis on a fictitious portfolio indicates higher var numbers , but poorer backtesting in comparison to the historical approach . this approach serves as an intermediate , and seems appropriate in periods such as the current one , wherein the historical numbers might be considerably lower than those of the implied . ( 4 ) winston will start testing using these hybrid vols , and if the results are deemed satisfactory , that will be the production methodology . of course , we will obtain all var numbers concurrently to serve as different indicators and beacons of risk . the production number will hopefully be a sensible compromise of the different methods . regards naveen

Subject: super saturday changes - update i am sure that all of you have seen the notice sent this morning from charlene jackson , managing director of the associate and analyst program . i wanted to follow up with a note to all campus team mds and it team members to clarify any confusion surrounding super saturdays and technologist recruiting for the global technology track . although the global technology track is part of the analyst and associate program - we will not be participating in the super saturday events listed below . technologist candidates will be brought into the office for a friday office visit . super saturdays were first initiated for commercial analyst and associate recruiting because many enron representatives were not able to leave their desks while the market was open during the workday . bringing candidates in during the weekend works well in this situation because enron representatives can fully participate in the office visit and candidates can still see the office . however , many technology vps have suggested that seeing enron " alive and in action " during the week would be a high selling point for technologist candidates . therefore , we have opted to have technology office visits on fridays . the first three office visits are listed below : november 10 th december lst january 19 th we will be sending out more detailed information on how you can become more involved with technology office visits . i apologize for any confusion . please feel free to contact me with any questions or comments . 3 - 3589 . thanks , ashley - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - forwarded by ashley baxter / corp / enron on 10 / 25 / 2000 08 : 56 am - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - from : charlene jackson 10 / 24 / 2000 09 : 20 pm sent by : enron announcements to : all enron employees north america cc : subject : super saturday changes the recruiting season has officially begun . the first super saturday weekend is the weekend of october 27 th and 28 th . we have undergone a rigorous interview process on campus , which will allow us to focus on  however , we are still in need of interviewers for each of the super saturdays . please respond with your willingness to interview at : http : / / axis . enron . com / notice / ssinvite . asp ( when selecting dates please avoid selecting to interview candidates who attend the schools for which you are a team member ) . we thank you in advance for your participation and support of the program .

Subject: todd hall sally , as you are probably aware the continental power book split project went well but there were a number of areas which were not completed for one reason or another but essentially it did not deliver according to the agreed timetable . todd was instrumental in helping me to drive this forward and was responsible for much of what we achieved . as you may also be aware we had some personnel issues and there have been significant changes in the continental risk management team . we have now recruited a strong manager in coralie evans from csfb and she starts on the 29 th of august . we have also added michelle waldhauser from the houston gas risk management team who arrived on the 7 th of august . there are a number of issues and developments which would greatly benefit from having todd here in london for around a month ( i say around a month as i am guessing within this period he would want to spend some time in oslo pushing the weather risk management area forward ) . attached is a page i put together that cover our immediate needs and why todd is ideally placed to potentially add an enormous amount of value to the continental power business . could we please get together with brent price and mike jordan and discuss whether todd would be available come over . thanks and regards james

( dyn ) terminated its troubled merger agreement with enron corp . ( ene ) , backing away from the deal despite frantic last - minute attempts by both sides to save it . dynegy wednesday cited enron ' s breaches of representations , warranties , convenants and agreements , including the material adverse change provision . the announcement came after standard & poor ' s cut the beleaguered energy trader ' s debt rating to b - minus , essentially rendering it to junk status . the downgrade triggered financial covenants and raised the possibility that enron will be forced to file for protection under chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code . that could be a fatal blow for enron , which needs huge sums of cheap money to keep its trading operations alive . standard & poor ' s lowered its long - term rating on enron to b - minus from triple - b - minus , citing fears that dynegy would abandon its proposed purchase of enron . the collapse of the dynegy purchase would create enormous pressure on enron ' s credit profile because of enron ' s limited access to capital at a time when extensive debt restructuring is necessary , s & p said . " while it is regrettable to see a leading industry player in difficulties , this doesn ' t reflect a failure for the energy merchant business , " dynegy said in announcing its decision . however , dynegy said its energy delivery network and core businesses are solid , and the company and its industry peers are ready to absorb any added volatility in the energy market as the result of the potential loss of enron . in afternoon trading on the new york stock exchange , enron shares were down $ 2 . 91 , or 71 % , to $ 1 . 20 . dynegy , meanwhile , was down $ 4 . 08 , or 10 % , at $ 36 . 81 , also on the big board . top executives of enron and dynegy had tried to salvage a deal to combine the two energy - trading companies amid growing signs that enron faced cash - flow problems as a result of a sharp downturn in its core trading business . talks between enron and dynegy began in earnest over the weekend to cut the price of the all - stock transaction after enron ' s share price had plummeted in the wake of disclosures that its future earnings wouldn ' t be as high as originally anticipated . last month dynegy agreed to buy enron after the emergence of damaging revelations concerning a series of deals that allowed enron executives to profit personally at the expense of the company and its shareholders . those deals are now the subject of a securities and exchange commission investigation . citing a person familiar with the situation , the wall street journal said wednesday that enron ' s board late tuesday had informally agreed to a new share - exchange ratio of 0 . 12 shares of dynegy for each enron share tendered , down more than 50 % from the original offer of 0 . 2685 dynegy share for each enron share . that latest proposed share - exchange ratio valued enron at $ 4 . 91 a share , or a total of $ 4 . 17 billion . that would compare with the original value of $ 10 . 98 a share , or $ 9 . 33 billion . in exchange for reducing the purchase price , some members of the enron team were insisting on more control over the merged company . dynegy also was considering an additional $ 250 million cash investment in enron . dynegy , together with chevrontexaco inc . ( cvx ) , has already injected $ 1 . 5 billion into enron in an effort to stabilize the company . while struggling to keep the planned merger alive , enron also has been seeking to extend the maturity dates of some of its borrowings . enron has a total of about $ 13 billion of debt , of which about $ 9 billion comes due by the end of next year . last month enron said in a filing with the sec that a cut in its rating to below investment grade by any of the three major credit rating agencies - along with a decline in its stock price below certain levels - would trigger the need to repay , refinance or cash collateralize facilities totaling $ 3 . 9 billion . dynegy said wednesday that it will go through with its acquisition of enron natural gas pipeline unit northern natural , omaha , neb . , and said it has exercised its right to acquire the unit ' s common shares . chevrontexaco , which owns 26 % of dynegy , contributed $ 1 . 5 billion to the proposed enron merger , and dynegy used that money to acquire the pipeline unit . northern natural , which owns and operates 16 , 500 miles of interstate natural gas pipeline spanning from the permian basin of texas to the great lakes , has historically been a strong earnings contributor . dynegy said the unit will be a positive addition to dynegy ' s own energy delivery network . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . enron ' s fall to spark volatility on pwr , natural gas mkts 11 / 28 / 2001 dow jones energy service ( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones 403 - 531 - 2912 dina . omeara @ dowjones . com copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . merger collapse , weak fed report , rattle investors at midafternoon by stacy forster 11 / 28 / 2001 dow jones business news ( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones & company , inc . ) the wall street journal online blue - chip stocks remained weak wednesday , after a key survey of regional conditions from the federal reserve revealed that many sectors of the economy continued to struggle . investors also were rattled by news that dynegy had pulled out of merger talks with fellow energy - provider enron . in midafternoon trading , the dow jones industrial average was down 111 points to 9761 , after flirting with a return to 10000 over the last two sessions . the industrials finished down 110 . 15 points , or 1 . 1 % , at 9872 . 60 tuesday . meanwhile , the nasdaq composite index lost 27 . 30 to 1908 . 70 , after declining 5 . 26 points to 1935 . 97 tuesday . other indexes also fell . the standard & poor ' s 500 - stock index shed 13 . 20 to 1136 . 40 , the russell 2000 index declined 3 to 457 . 70 , and the new york stock exchange composite index dropped 4 . 90 to 579 . 70 . the fed ' s so - called beige book indicated the economy remained soft in october and november . the survey showed " signs of further slowing outweighed signs of recovery " in early november .

( ene ) will survive the company ' s troubles , but they won ' t emerge unscathed , traders and analysts said wednesday . energy companies have had weeks to adjust to serious concerns about the houston - based giant ' s creditworthiness , allowing a more or less orderly withdrawal of enron from the market before ratings agencies wednesday downgraded enron ' s credit to junk - bond levels . nevertheless , liquidity in the north american natural gas and electricity markets is expected to suffer and credit requirements are likely to be tightened in general , creating difficulties for some energy traders . " this doesn ' t spell the end of energy trading , " said one trading manager for an independent power producer . " the market is much bigger than enron , and that ' s why enron fell . this does spell the spell the end of trading for companies that don ' t have a strong physical asset base for at least a year or two as credit requirements are generally tightened , " moreover , small producers of natural gas or electricity that hedged their 2002 output with enron earlier this year - when prices were much higher than they are now - will suffer if enron has trouble fulfilling those commitments . enron warned in a filing with the securities and exchange commission last week that its ability to continue as a going concern would be threatened if its credit ratings were downgraded to noninvestment grade levels . news of enron ' s downgrade added 5 cents to 10 cents to natural gas futures at the new york mercantile exchange , as traders covering short positions sent the december contract to $ 2 . 82 per million british thermal units , traders said . midwestern and southeastern power prices were also said to have risen due to trading inefficiencies after enron turned off its internet - based trading platform enrononline and higher gas prices . prices have in all those markets have since fallen , but the moves point to the increased volatility and lessened efficiency some analysts and traders expect should enron exit the market entirely . kyle cooper , energy analyst at salomon smith barney , said traders will have to present wider bid - offer spreads in order to get deals done in markets in which enron provided critical liquidity . " one less player , one less market , because of the illiquidity , " cooper said . at one time , enron accounted for about a quarter of all trade in the north american gas and power markets . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . uk : enron - a pioneer of europe ' s new power markets . by stuart penson 11 / 28 / 2001 reuters english news service ( c ) reuters limited 2001 . london , nov 28 ( reuters ) - u . s . group enron , on the brink of collapse on wednesday , has been a pioneer of energy dealing in europe and its demise would rob utilities across the continent of a key trading partner . with a european staff of 5 , 000 , offices in most major cities and a lavish headquarters overlooking london ' s buckingham palace , enron created the trading culture now embraced by previously sceptical european utilities as markets open up to competition . until recently , enron had accounted for about 30 percent of german wholesale power trading . it was also a major player in uk gas and electricity and nordic power , and was driving forward a fledgling french power market . " on average we are now doing around 200 deals a day with about 300 counterparties , " enron ' s director of continental power trading gregor baeumerich told reuters in an interview last month , days before the group was plunged into its current crisis . britain ' s forward gas market rallied on wednesday as it emerged that a rescue deal from smaller rival dynegy had unravelled and enron looked to be skating dangerously close to bankruptcy . enron ' s list of trading partners included major utilities such as german giants e . on and rwe and the uk ' s innogy and british energy u . s . companies with trading desk in europe , such as txu , aep , dynegy and duke energy , also traded with enron . the company ' s enrononline internet trading platform , suspended earlier on wednesday , set the standard for online trading , offering a blueprint followed by utilities and brokers . enron did about 60 percent of its trade through the platform . the group ' s presence in europe is not confined to trading . the company has around 4 , 000 megawatts of power generation , spanning italy , poland , greece and the uk where it owns one of the biggest plants at teesside . the company built a reputation for hard - nosed trading expertise in europe ' s previously pedestrian utilities industry and its approach seemed almost evangelical . in the summer , flushed with confidence , the company placed a bmw sports car in the lobby of its london office , a prize for employees successful in recruiting fresh talent for the enron cause . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . usa : wrapup 2 - enron near collapse after dynegy pulls out . by c . bryson hull 11 / 28 / 2001 reuters english news service ( c ) reuters limited 2001 . houston , nov 28 ( reuters ) - enron corp . swooned at the edge of one of the biggest corporate collapses in u . s . history on wednesday as its rescue by rival dynegy inc . blew apart . dynegy accused enron of breaching the representations it made when a takeover agreement was negotiated on nov . 9 , invoking an escape clause that let it pull out of the all - stock deal valued at $ 9 . 3 billion at the time . shares of enron , recently ranked no . 7 on the fortune 500 list of the biggest u . s . companies , had lost most of their value in the past three weeks , and all three major credit rating agencies had slashed their ratings on enron ' s bonds to junk status by the time dynegy made its announcement . enron ' s latest disaster marked another low in a stunning free - fall that began innocently enough with the announcement of a $ 638 million quarterly loss six weeks ago . surprise disclosures , including the admission it overstated earnings by almost $ 600 million since 1997 and kept huge debts off its balance sheet , led investors to rapidly lose faith in a company valued at almost $ 80 billion a little more than a year ago . on wednesday , its market value was less than $ 500 million . in response to dynegy ' s announcements and credit rating downgrades , enron said it will temporary suspend all payments other than those necessary to maintain its core operations . kenneth l . lay , enron ' s chairman and chief executive , said the company was evaluating and exploring other options to protect its core energy businesses . the loss of enron ' s investment - grade credit rating forces some $ 3 . 9 billion in debts to come due immediately , a major problem for a company that has spent most of the $ 5 . 5 billion it sought in recent weeks to stay afloat . enron said in a recent regulatory filing that it was unlikely to " continue as a going concern " were its credit rating to be slashed to junk status . it became increasingly clear , as dynegy sought to renegotiate the deal , that enron ' s tricky and often indecipherable accounting was becoming a sticking point , sources close to the negotiations said . " while it is regrettable to see a leading industry player in difficulties , this does not reflect a failure of the merchant energy business , " dynegy chairman and chief executive officer chuck watson said in a statement . dynegy said it would exercise its option to buy enron ' s northern natural gas pipeline with the $ 1 . 5 billion it and partner chevrontexaco put into the deal . dynegy said it stopped trading with enron as of wednesday morning , pegging its exposure at $ 75 million . a bad sign came earlier on wednesday , as energy traders said operations had stopped at enron ' s once highly lucrative online trading system , enrononline . the unit accounted for up to 90 percent of enron ' s earnings , and was considered the jewel of the trading franchise that dynegy coveted most in its planned $ 9 . 3 billion all - stock takeover . risk management failures enron , which touted itself as an agile risk manager , found its credit and debt had spiraled out of control as a series of partnerships designed to hide debt off of its balance sheet caused investors to lose faith in recent weeks . the partnerships , which included top enron executives and are the subject of a u . s . securities and exchange investigation , provided financing in exchange for guarantees that enron ' s stock stay above certain levels and its credit remain investment - grade . but they came back onto the balance sheet with a vengeance , as enron found it would have to meet massive debt obligations as its shares and credit fell . enron shares plunged $ 3 . 53 , or 85 percent , to 61 cents on wednesday , as the new york stock exchange twice halted trading of enron shares before announcements affecting the company . it ' s stock has fallen more than 98 percent this year . the stock peaked at $ 90 . 56 in august 2000 , riding high on the cresting wave of the technology boom after enron took its trading outfit online and promised to bring its business model into the broadband communications arena . " they ( enron ) entrapped the sophisticates , " said robert stovall , senior strategist at prudential securities , referring to what was once an almost fawning admiration for enron by institutional investors . " i think this is going to become a classic case . " stovall , with nearly 50 years of wall street experience , said he could not recall any previous corporate unraveling that matches that of enron . " you would have to go to pre - sec days for that , " he said , referring to the creation of the sec in the aftermath of the stock market crash of 1929 . the final cuts standard & poor ' s , moody ' s investors service and fitch all cut their ratings on the fallen energy trading giant ' s debt to junk status . s & p said it had lost confidence in enron ' s ability to complete the merger with dynegy , and said bankruptcy was a " distinct possibility " if the merger fails . andre meade , a commerzbank analyst who has been consistently bearish on enron and the deal , said its core business deteriorated at an increasing pace in recent weeks , and the ratings agencies could not find the liquidity they wanted inside enron . " the numbers were not enough to soothe them , " said meade , who downgraded enron to " sell " from " hold " on wednesday . " this company should have been downgraded to junk weeks ago . the ratings agencies had given them several weeks , and they just couldn ' t hold out anymore . " dynegy on nov . 9 said it would take over enron in a deal valued at about $ 10 . 41 per enron share . chevrontexaco corp . , a major dynegy shareholder , pledged to immediately pump $ 1 . 5 billion into enron to bolster its withering finances . deal advisers j . p . morgan chase and citigroup have already contributed $ 1 billion to the deal , and were expected to have to put up after enron was rebuffed by private equity firms it had approached seeking more cash . representatives of dynegy and enron had haggled over new terms for the takeover late into tuesday , including a buyout offer half the original price , sources close to the talks said . enron ' s crash began when it said it would take $ 1 . 01 billion in writedowns and charges against its third - quarter earnings for failed investments . it later admitted that it had to reduce stockholder equity by $ 1 . 2 billion to extract itself from partnerships in which now - ousted chief financial officer andrew fastow the managing partner . those deals , in which fastow earned about $ 30 million in management fees , are the subject of an sec investigation and the . worse yet for enron , it was required to restate its earnings going back four years , shaving off $ 600 million in the process .

" i can ' t right now envision anything the government can do , other than encourage the parties who are discussing a merger to continue their efforts , " said billy tauzin , republican of louisiana . but he said the government must watch carefully whether the troubles of the houston - based enron - once ranked as the nation ' s largest trader of electricity and natural gas - had implications for u . s . energy supplies and pricing . tauzin noted that enron had been a " very big contributor " to energy supplies in california , which was rocked last winter by a tenfold jump in wholesale electricity prices , a string of black - outs and the bankruptcy of the state ' s largest utility . " we ' ve got to watch that very carefully , obviously . we don ' t want to be in another session next year trying to deal with energy problems in california as a result of some of the events that are occurring right now with enron , " tauzin said . the underlying cause of california ' s problems last winter was widely seen as the state ' s badly written electricity deregulation law , which did not allow power companies to pass through higher wholesale electricity costs to consumers . tauzin said enron ' s decline was unfortunate .

then came last year , when the common shares recorded their best performance in more than two decades even as u . s . stocks stumbled . enron rallied 87 percent amid soaring electricity and natural gas prices , while the standard & poor ' s 500 index , a market benchmark that includes the company , fell 10 percent . company shares in the plan rose in value by $ 652 . 7 million , according to an sec filing . the total includes shares bought and sold throughout the year . by contrast , mutual - fund holdings fell by $ 47 million and ` ` other investments ' ' rose by just $ 134 , 000 , the filing said . at year - end , the 401 ( k ) plan owned 13 . 9 million enron common shares and 70 , 000 preferred shares , valued at $ 1 . 32 billion . this total encompasses not only enron ' s matching contributions to the plan , but also employees ' investments with their own money . the company generally provides a 50 percent match , in stock , for the first 6 percent of pay that goes into the plan . employees can ' t sell the shares and move the proceeds into other investment choices until they reach the age of 50 . company contributions accounted for about 11 percent of the plan ' s stock holdings , said karen denne , an enron spokeswoman . the figure suggests employees invested more heavily in their company than usual for 401 ( k ) participants . waiting for data for the average u . s . plan account , company stock amounted to 19 percent of assets at the end of last year , according to a study done by the employee benefit research institute and the investment company institute and published last week . in any case , enron ' s approach to matching ensures that as much as one - third of the contribution to an employee ' s account takes the form of shares that they can ' t sell right away . anyone who wanted to gauge how this approach , and enron ' s stock performance , affected the plan ' s financial position last year had to wait until june 27 . that ' s when the filing cited earlier arrived at the sec . employee savings and stock - purchase plans , such as 401 ( k ) plans , don ' t have to submit annual reports until 180 days after their fiscal year ends . they can even get a 15 - day extension of the deadline if they need one . by the time enron ' s plan made its annual report , it was already a bit too late to act on the information . the company ' s shares dropped 44 percent between the end of 2000 and the date of the submission . as the filing demonstrated , employees looking to save for retirement had been set up for a fall . enron ' s credit rating cut to junk by s & p and moody ' s ( update 4 ) 2001 - 11 - 28 14 : 38 ( new york ) enron ' s credit rating cut to junk by s & p and moody ' s ( update 4 ) ( updates with analyst comment in third paragraph , fitch rating in fourth paragraph and shares in sixth paragraph . ) new york , nov . 28 ( bloomberg ) - - standard & poor ' s , moody ' s investors service and fitch , inc . slashed enron corp .

' ' cash burn shipman said in his report that ` ` the willingness of dynegy to complete its planned acquisition of enron has been compromised by the continued drop in confidence in the capital markets that the transaction would hold . ' ' credit analysts also focused on enron ' s ` ` cash burn ' ' rate , diaz said . enron said in its most recent filing last week that it had $ 1 billion in cash , which was a lot less than the market had expected , diaz said . ` ` it came as a surprise to us and to others , ' ' he said . ` ` we expected at least $ 2 . 5 billion so they would have staying power .

" there is just too much risk , " said a trader at a new york risk arbitrage firm . " nobody wants to even get close to the deal . " perhaps most telling about the uncertainty surrounding enron and the merger with dynegy is the fact that even a 68 % risk premium over the value of the dynegy deal has so far failed to attract investors . " the deal appears in real jeopardy here , " a bond trader said . under the merger plan , enron holders would receive 0 . 2685 dynegy share for each enron share . at dynegy ' s current share price of $ 41 . 77 , that means the value of the deal is about $ 11 . 20 a share for enron holders . but enron stock recently traded as low as $ 6 . 68 a share , almost 68 % below the value of the merger . adding to doubts about enron ' s long - term viability , the company said in a delayed quarterly filing late monday that its ability to continue as a going concern depends on a number of factors , including being able to retain an investment grade credit rating . dynegy declined to comment on whether its decision to merge with enron would be affected by the company ' s latest securities and exchange commission filing , including the disclosure that enron will have to repay $ 690 million in debt by next tuesday if it doesn ' t come up with collateral for a loan . an enron spokeswoman wasn ' t available to comment on the merger plan . among other bad news , enron ' s latest report warned investors that the company faces immediate demand for $ 3 . 9 billion in debt if its credit rating is downgraded any further . earlier this month , standard & poor ' s corp . and moody ' s investors service cut enron ' s credit ratings to " bbb - " and " baa 3 " , just one notch higher than below - investment grade , or " junk " status . the rating agencies warned that they may cut their respective ratings again . neither s 201 - 938 - 2074 ; dow jones newswires carol . remond @ dowjones . com copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . dynegy won ' t comment on merger partner enron ' s 10 - q by christina cheddar of dow jones newswires 11 / 20 / 2001 dow jones news service ( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones & company , inc . ) new york - ( dow jones ) - dynegy inc .

' ' bowsher said . the pob , a private group created to oversee the accounting industry ' s self - governance as an advocate for the public , will take the matter up at a closed meeting in washington on dec . 4 , he said . houston - based enron , the largest energy trader , earlier this month reported that it overstated earnings by $ 586 million over four - and - a - half years , inflated shareholder equity by $ 1 . 2 billion because of an ` ` accounting error , ' ' and failed to consolidate results of three affiliated partnerships into its balance sheet . andersen , the world ' s fifth - largest accounting firm , served as enron ' s outside auditor for more than a decade , assuring investors that the company ' s financial statements conformed with generally accepted accounting principles . the sec is investigating some of enron ' s partnerships . firms that audit public companies submit to ` ` peer reviews ' ' of their accounting practices by other accounting firms , a practice aimed at assuring the investing public that the firm complies with professional standards . u . s . representative john dingell , a michigan democrat , said yesterday in a letter to bowsher that none of the big five accounting firms has ever issued a negative report against another at the end of any peer review . dingell skeptical ` ` there appears to be little reason for the public to have faith in andersen or the peer review process , ' ' dingell wrote . andersen responded saying it had faith in the accounting profession ' s self - regulatory process , which the pob oversees . a spokeswoman at deloitte & touche llp , andersen ' s peer - reviewer , didn ' t return a telephone call seeking comment . deloitte , the third - largest reviewer , is conducting a peer review of andersen now . bowsher , a former u . s . comptroller general , said the pob was thinking of looking into peer review issues before receiving dingell ' s letter . ` ` but this letter certainly focuses the issue , ' ' he said . dingell ' s letter said the outside counsel to a special committee of enron ' s board has retained deloitte & touche to help it review the company ' s accounting problems . conflict of interest ? ` ` do dt ' s dual roles create a conflict of interest ? ' ' dingell ' s letter asked . ` ` if dt finds numerous problems on enron , will dt try to ` whitewash ' or reconcile them in order to be able to issue a clean peer review report ? ' ' dingell also questioned whether the money andersen pays deloitte & touche for its current peer review will sway the outcome . ` ` how will this influence , if at all , dt ' s ` independent ' judgment of andersen ' s work on enron ? ' ' the letter said . bowsher responded : ` there ' s nothing we can do to change the fact that deloitte & touche has done the previous reviews of andersen . now , the question is should they ( the outside counsel ) use the same firm , or would it be better for them to use another firm ? and that ' s pretty much their decision . ' ' bowsher said he has no knowledge of the accounting problems at enron beyond what he ' s read in newspapers . ` ` it looks pretty bad , doesn ' t it ? , ' ' he said . expanded power dingell ' s request could prove a test of the pob ' s recently expanded power and oversight . the group ' s charter was revised earlier this year to make the pob the accounting industry ' s premier watchdog group following criticisms by former sec chairman arthur levitt and former sec chief accountant lynn turner . they criticized the ` ` alphabet soup ' ' of accounting self - regulators and voiced frustration with the industry ' s oversight of itself . the new charter put the pob in charge of supervising the setting of auditing and audit - independence standards and monitoring how firms audit public companies . it also gave the board , which is funded by the industry , the power to set its own budget with no strings attached . ` ` now , for the first time , we will see if the pob is able to act in the public interest and undertake the mandate presented to it by congressman dingell and by its new charter , ' ' turner said . ` ` they didn ' t have the power in the past . ' ' the pob was set up in 1977 to represent the public interest in overseeing the accounting industry ' s self - governance structure . before its charter was revised , the pob was just one facet of the enforcement of auditing industry standards regarding publicly traded companies . now , it oversees the activities of these other groups as well . newpower plugs cash drain by revamping power pact with enron 2001 - 11 - 20 11 : 05 ( new york ) newpower plugs cash drain by revamping power pact with enron washington , nov . 20 ( bloomberg ) - - newpower holdings inc . , one of the first companies to market power to homeowners nationwide , recently plugged a cash drain brought on by plunging energy prices . the purchase , new york , company buys gas and electricity from suppliers such as enron corp . and resells the energy to residential and small business customers in states such as pennsylvania , ohio , georgia and texas . newpower markets its service as an alternative to local utilities in restructured retail energy markets . recent declines in energy prices have required newpower to deposit $ 110 million in cash with enron , its largest shareholder as well as a major creditor , leaving the company with about $ 33 million . according to a regulatory filing , enron recently agreed to allow newpower to replace some of the cash collateral with assets such as inventory and customer ious . ` ` we had a certain amount of cash tied up in those collateral positions , ' ' said william jacobs , chief financial officer at newpower . ` ` obviously , every dollar you put up there reduces the amount of money you can spend other places . ' ' newpower represents a new breed of energy middleman that contracts to provide power to retail customers at certain prices . rather than owning power plants and gas pipelines , though , the company simply purchases energy - - at slightly lower prices - - from suppliers such as enron . the contracts with enron require newpower to post collateral with the supplier if the market price of natural gas or electricity falls below the price set in the contract . and prices for natural gas , used to fuel most electricity plants , have plunged . offsetting contracts natural gas for december delivery fell 4 . 6 cents to $ 2 . 740 per million british thermal units on the new york mercantile exchange . that is down from a record $ 10 . 10 per million british thermal units last december . newpower isn ' t at risk of losing money because the company has offsetting contracts to sell the electricity and natural gas at even higher prices to retail customers . it ' s more of a timing issue : the company has had to post the collateral before the sales under these retail contracts take place . nevertheless , the need to provide collateral has weighed heavily on newpower ' s balance sheet . cash and cash equivalents have declined to $ 33 . 4 million on sept . 30 from $ 179 . 9 million on dec . 31 , 2000 . meanwhile , restricted cash , such as the collateral provided to enron and others , has ballooned to $ 180 . 2 million from $ 16 . 2 million during the same period . other transactions on oct . 18 , according to a quarterly report filed with the securities and exchange commission , enron agreed to permit newpower to substitute inventory and customer receivables for as much as $ 40 million of the cash collateral . this agreement will expire jan . 4 , 2002 . ` ` assuming broadly stable forward energy prices , ' ' the filing said , newpower ` ` has sufficient financial resources to conduct its business until it secures permanent asset - backed or similar financing . ' ' the company also said in the sec filing that it has recently entered into a series of transactions ` ` to reduce the risk of posting additional cash as collateral ' ' if energy prices fall further . these transactions , which the company says are an exception to its usual hedging strategy , ` ` increase the company ' s exposure to commodity price fluctuations .

" it ' s another surprise to the industry . we don ' t need any more surprises , " malik told reporters at a press presentation of a new index devised by houston - based reliant to track natural gas consumption . reliant is a big wholesale electricity and natural gas trader and as such both a competitor and trading counterparty of enron . malik said enron executives had not mentioned the potential payment of $ 690 million during a conference call with analysts on nov . 14 , two days before the credit rating downgrade that triggered it on nov . 12 . enron agreed to be acquired by smaller rival dynegy inc . for some $ 9 billion in stock on nov . 9 after a collapse in investor confidence and snowballing financial problems brought enron to the brink of collapse . dynegy wrote clauses into its agreement with enron that allow it to walk away from the deal if the problems at enron turn out to be far worse than previously disclosed , but dynegy executives have said it is unlikely those clauses will be invoked . malik said that as a trading partner in wholesale energy markets , reliant will seek further clarification from enron about its financial position . " my guess is that they are going to have a hard time coming up with the money , " he said . malik said enron ' s bids and offers in the wholesale electricity and natural gas markets had become less competitive in recent weeks and that this had allowed reliant and other companies to capture some market share from enron . reliant continued to do business with enron , he said , but was exercising " heightened caution " . malik said reliant had not hired any traders away from enron recently and was currently well staffed .

' ' bowsher , a former u . s . comptroller general , asked in an interview . the board ' s examination will consider the broad issue of industry oversight , leaving specific review of enron ' s audits to the securities and exchange commission , he said . houston - based enron , the largest energy trader , this month said it overstated earnings by $ 586 million over four - and - a - half years , inflated shareholder equity by $ 1 . 2 billion because of an accounting error , and failed to consolidate results of three affiliated partnerships into its balance sheet . the oversight board , created to supervise the accounting industry ' s self - governance practices , will address the issue dec . 4 , bowsher said . andersen , the world ' s fifth - largest accounting firm , was enron ' s outside auditor for more than a decade , assuring investors that the company ' s financial statements conformed with generally accepted accounting principles . deloitte & touche llp has been the firm assigned to do andersen ' s peer reviews . dingell skeptical u . s . representative john dingell , a michigan democrat , questioned the peer review process yesterday in a letter to bowsher . none of the five biggest international accounting firms has ever issued a negative peer - review report against another , dingell said . the so - called big five are andersen , deloitte & touche , llc , kpmg llp , and ernst & young lp . ` ` there appears to be little reason for the public to have faith in andersen or the peer review process , ' ' dingell wrote . andersen responded that it has faith in the accounting profession ' s self - regulatory process , which the pob oversees . a spokeswoman at deloitte & touche didn ' t return a telephone call seeking comment . the oversight board was thinking of looking into peer review issues before receiving dingell ' s letter , bowsher said . ` ` but this letter certainly focuses the issue , ' ' he said . conflict of interest ? dingell ' s letter said the outside counsel to a special committee of enron ' s board has retained deloitte & touche - - andersen ' s peer reviewer - - to help it examine the company ' s accounting problems . ` ` do ( deloitte & touche ' s ) dual roles create a conflict of interest ? ' ' dingell ' s letter asked . ` ` if ( deloitte & touche ) finds numerous problems on enron , will ( deloitte & touche ) try to ` whitewash ' or reconcile them in order to be able to issue a clean peer review report ? ' ' dingell also questioned whether the money andersen pays deloitte & touche for its peer review will sway the outcome . ` ` how will this influence , if at all , ( deloitte & touche ' s ) ` independent ' judgment of andersen ' s work on enron ? ' ' dingell asked . bowsher there is ` ` nothing we can do to change the fact that deloitte & touche has done the previous reviews of andersen . now , the question is should they ( the outside counsel ) use the same firm , or would it be better for them to use another firm ? and that ' s pretty much their decision . ' ' expanded power dingell ' s request could prove a test of the oversight board ' s expanded power and oversight . the group ' s charter was revised earlier this year to make the board the accounting industry ' s premier watchdog group , following criticisms by former sec chairman arthur levitt and former sec chief accountant lynn turner . they criticized an ` ` alphabet soup ' ' of accounting self - regulators and voiced frustration with the industry ' s oversight of itself . the new charter put the oversight board in charge of supervising the setting of auditing and audit - independence standards and monitoring how firms audit public companies . it also gave the board , which is funded by the industry , the power to set its own budget with no strings attached . ` ` now , for the first time , we will see if the pob is able to act in the public interest and undertake the mandate presented to it by congressman dingell and by its new charter , ' ' turner said . ` ` they didn ' t have the power in the past . ' ' the public oversight board was set up in 1977 to represent the public interest in overseeing the accounting industry ' s self - governance structure . before its charter was revised , the board was just one facet of the enforcement of auditing industry standards regarding publicly traded companies . now , it oversees the activities of these other groups as well . energy cos limit business with enron after 10 q - traders by mark golden of dow jones newswires 11 / 20 / 2001 dow jones energy service ( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones & company , inc . ) new york - ( dow jones ) - many energy trading companies were unwilling to sell power and natural gas for next day delivery to enron corp . ( ene ) tuesday morning , a result of heightened credit concerns following the release of enron ' s quarterly financial report monday , traders and other sources said . for weeks , companies have limited both buying and selling with enron for future deliveries . but for the first time since enron ' s troubles began a month ago , energy companies weren ' t selling to enron in the spot markets for fear that enron might not be able to pay its bills as soon as next month . " it ' s pretty well accepted in the industry that people are staying away for now , " said charlie sanchez , energy market manager for gelber & associates in houston . traders at all of the major companies contacted said they couldn ' t sell to enron tuesday morning . several spokespeople for energy companies confirmed the situation , but declined to say so on the record . " nobody will take enron , " one western electricity broker said . after struggling , however , that broker eventually found a utility that was willing to sell to enron tuesday morning . calpine , a prominent independent power producer and trader , said it was willing to sell power to enron . " we continue to sell power to enron and are monitoring the situation closely , " spokeswoman catherine potter said . the situation tuesday morning was fluid . one utility that refused to sell to enron in the morning was willing to do so in the afternoon , a person at the company said . that company ' s trading , however , was still limited to the spot markets . credit concerns about the once - dominant energy trading company were heightened with enron ' s filing of its third quarter annual report monday evening with the u . s . securities exchange commission . enron may have to pay $ 690 million on a note that became a demand obligation with the company ' s most recent credit - rating downgrade , enron said in monday ' s filing . the company also warned that its profits in the fourth quarter could be hurt by credit concerns , a decline in asset values and reduced trading activity . " the 10 q in and by itself is a document that could raise concerns , " fitch analyst ralph pellecchia said . " we have a lot of questions outstanding relative to disclosures that were new to us and their strategies of how they are going to manage the situation . " companies are willing to buy from enron in the spot gas and power markets , because taking delivery on commodity and paying for it a month later poses no credit risk for the buyer an enron spokesman didn ' t respond to a request for comment . reliant resources ( rri ) and the bonneville power administration , the federal government ' s western power marketer , both said their organizations are continuing to " do business " with enron . but when asked specifically if they were selling spot power or gas to enron , spokesmen for both declined to comment . " we ' re watching the situation very carefully , " said reliant spokesman richard wheatley . " there is a lot of speculation because of the filing yesterday . " energy companies began shying away from enron over the past month , as concerns about its finances precipitated a 75 % drop in its stock price and left its bonds trading at levels typically associated with junk - rated debt . traders and their companies have said consistently that until enron ' s credit ratings improve , they will continue to watch their exposure to enron carefully , with trades limited to short - term deals . moody ' s investors service , standard & poor ' s and fitch all rate enron one notch above speculative grade . moody ' s has enron ' s ratings on review for a downgrade , and s & p has enron on negative credit watch . fitch calls enron ' s credit rating " evolving . " enron ' s ability to do business in the energy markets depends on its maintaining investment - grade ratings . the manager of one hedge fund that follows enron closely said tuesday that several trading companies expressed strong concerns about enron ' s financial viability . but the manager thought those concerns weren ' t proportionate to enron ' s position . " they have nine days to work out the $ 690 million debt payment , and if they can ' t work it out , they have the cash to make the payment , " the manager said . dynegy inc . ( dyn ) , which has agreed to buy enron in a stock - swap currently worth about $ 10 billion , injected $ 1 . 5 billion into enron last week . enron has also closed on $ 1 billion worth of revolving credit lines with j . p . morgan chase & co . ( jpm ) and citigroup ( c ) in the past week , with $ 450 million of that amount closed monday . developments with enron , however , have raised enough concerns that energy companies aren ' t willing to extend themselves into positions that have even the appearance of vulnerability , sanchez of gelber & associates said . " the industry has been shell - shocked by their recent announcements , and they ' re not ready to go back to trading with them , " said sanchez of gelber 201 - 938 - 4604 ; mark . golden @ dowjones . com ( john edmiston in houston , kristen mcnamara in new york and jon kamp in chicago contributed to this article . ) reached later , dynegy made clear it wouldn ' t take any extraordinary measures to support enron in the market .

' s ( dyn ) request for regulatory exemption of its planned liquefied natural gas , or lng , import terminal on the u . s . gulf coast . in what would be the first new lng import site in nearly two decades , dynegy has proposed converting an existing terminal in hackberry , la . , to receive lng imports at a rate of up to 750 million cubic feet a day with capacity to later expand up to 1 . 5 billion cubic feet a day . in its august application to ferc , dynegy said lng import terminals should no longer face regulatory burdens designed in the 1970 s . tuesday , ferc said " there is no indication that congress intended to remove commission jurisdiction over the siting , construction , and operation of lng import facilities . " the commission added that " there would be a regulatory gap without commission jurisdiction . " ferc chairman pat wood said it was a close decision to deny the company ' s request , although commissioners voted unanimously to do so . commissioner william massey said granting a regulatory waiver would have made it impossible to ensure open access to the lng facility , which he described as " a gatekeeper to the u . s . market . " three of the four existing u . s . lng import terminals are under strict ferc price regulations . dynegy said these regulations and the guaranteed cost recovery they entail led to unnecessary lng investment in the early 1980 s . the company argued that lng imports should be treated as " first sale " gas over which the commission has no jurisdiction . dynegy announced the project in july and planned to begin receiving lng shipments by the end of 2003 . the project involves converting an existing liquefied petroleum gas terminal and dock to receive lng . dynegy plans to convert an lpg tanker under construction to carry lng instead by the targeted fourth - quarter 2003 start of operations , and it would seek additional lng tankers in 2004 . companies use lng tankers and terminals to import gas from remote overseas gas fields in countries such as algeria , trinidad 202 - 862 - 9291 ; campion . walsh @ dowjones . com copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . usa : update 2 - enron stock hits decade low after debt warning . 11 / 20 / 2001 reuters english news service ( c ) reuters limited 2001 .

" the facts have not changed so dramatically for the stock to be down this magnitude , " barbis said . on monday , enron disclosed it is up against a nov . 26 deadline , when it must deliver collateral against the debt owed to a third party in one of its myriad partnerships . if not , the partner has the right to liquidate all of the assets of the partnership , which include a brazilian natural gas company that enron was counting on selling to raise $ 250 million in cash . enron is working to make alternative payment arrangements , since it can ill - afford to pay the debt now . enron has already already maxed out its $ 3 billion credit line , secured roughly $ 2 billion in loans and is looking for more cash to stay afloat . " enron has access to more than $ 3 billion in cash . they can pay off this note . they have cash coming in and are not illiquid , " said barbis .

charles kadlec , j & w seligman : well , it ` s obvious you can ` t catch them because , if we could have , we would have . the best analysts on the street missed this one . i think the real message here is the importance of diversification . and i think it also raises some important questions about corporate governance at enron . and there , clearly , was something missing not only among the senior executive officers of that corporation but the board of directors as well . schaffler : in general , we ` re seeing the markets just sort of retreat here . but it seems to be one of these sort of calm pullbacks we ` ve talked so much throughout the show . the dow started the day up better than 20 percent . the nasdaq up about 30 percent from the lows . and the one situation we ` ve had when the markets pulled back , through those couple of weeks , is the buyers always come back in . we know that fund inflows were up in october . we also know october sometimes is when we see bottoms in markets . just historically it seems that it happens in october . the data on the fund flows , does that intrigue you at all ? kadlec : well , i think it ` s just another of those straws in the wind , if you will . the leading economic indicators being up 0 . 3 percent today . i wouldn ` t bet the ranch on that single number , but it ` s positive , better than expected . positive inflows suggest that fear , which was not only impacting the market , was clearly impacting the economy , starting to recede that ` s a positive . and i think individual investors are beginning to look beyond the immediate news into next year . and , you know , we ` ve had nine recessions . up until now , we ` ve had nine recoveries . we ` re probably in the middle of the 10 th recession . and we ` re going to have a recovery . so , as people begin to try to size up the shape and the duration of that recovery , they ` re beginning to , again , deploy their assets back into equities , which provide the best long - term returns of any asset class . schaffler : it ` s interesting too because , you know , we ` ve talked through the last couple of months it was always the cash on the sidelines . you know , we kept quoting how much was in money market funds just waiting to be deployed . do you have any sense of how much momentum there is still to come into this market ? how much money there might still be out there ? do you get the idea that the institutions as well as some retail customers might still be holding on to some money to re - deploy assets at this point ? kadlec : my sense is that - like at seligman , for example , our teams are really focused on positioning the portfolios and to take advantage of the upturn that ` s coming . so you ` re seeing a move more toward cyclicals . selecting really good companies that perhaps are oversold . we ` re also seeing horizons lengthen out a little bit . people beginning to think of what all of next year is going to look like . really , very little attention to what ` s happening in the fourth quarter of this year . we already know the economy ` s in trouble . if anything , we ` re set up for a positive surprise i think over the holiday season in terms of the consumer here . schaffler : let ` s find out exactly what ` s going on now at the big board . we know that stocks are moving lower . copyright ?

( ene ) has been the country ' s most aggressive advocate of opening energy markets to competition , and enron is now on the ropes , slated if all goes as planned to be absorbed by smaller rival dynegy inc . ( dyn ) . but industry observers said its demise won ' t open a leadership void in the regulatory battle . while enron ' s efforts were critical in the early efforts to pry open markets , that work has largely been done , and there are now plenty of like - minded companies able step in , observers said . " it is true that enron has been a leader in pushing policies for a competitive market , " said linda stuntz , a former top energy department official now with stuntz , davis & staffier . " but the news is they ' re not alone any more . there are a lot of others who will carry the flag . " enron , an object lesson in how the mighty have fallen , has been the industry ' s undisputed leader in pushing for competitive power markets at both the federal and state levels . the company is a dominant player in any policy debate before the federal energy regulatory commission , and its positions weigh heavily as congress debates electric industry reform legislation . lobbyists describe enron ' s washington office as " huge , " far surpassing that of dynegy . enron also had tremendous political clout . the company successfully backed top texas regulator pat wood iii for the ferc chairmanship earlier this year . enron chairman ken lay has been a key political backer of president george w . bush , raising at least $ 100 , 000 for his campaign . the company itself contributed $ 114 , 000 . enron spent $ 2 . 4 million in the last federal election cycle , making it one of the nation ' s biggest political contributors , according to the center for responsive politics , an advocacy group that monitors political campaign spending and influence . " the company ' s contribution total for the 2000 elections more than doubled its political donations in each of the two previous election cycles , " the center reports . broad support seen for markets no company has come close to making enron ' s commitment to shaping the laws and regulations that govern the energy industry . still , industry observers see support for competitive energy markets even without enron ' s largess . " i think that there is a tremendous political will from all the leaders on all sides of congress and the administration to move forward on electricity competition legislation , " said edison electric institute president thomas kuhn . " i don ' t the think the enron situation is going to make any difference at all . officials with the two companies adamantly reject the premise that their merger will create a vacuum in the push for greater competition in the $ 220 billion electricity sector . " dynegy ' s going to continue to advocate open and competitive markets , " spokesman steve stengel said . " i can ' t speculate on what the new company is going to spend on lobbying efforts or what the combined entities ' staff will look like . but clearly enron and dynegy share a belief in open and competitive markets , and the new entity will certainly continue to be vocal about opening markets to competition . " rick shapiro , enron ' s managing director of global government affairs , echoed that view . he also said it was unlikely opponents of deregulation would succeed in using enron ' s troubles as a reason not to further open markets . " there will be companies that will try to use enron ' s business problems as a reason to not move forward . but regulators will separate what happened to enron from the rightness of the idea , " shapiro said . " the validity of competition has been proven over and over again . this is not going to have a long - term effect . " dynegy will probably inherit some of enron ' s aggressiveness in lobbying , stuntz said . state - level view mixed energy lawyers suggested that , in many respects , the public policy debate over competition has already been won . for instance , one - third of the power - generation capacity in the u . s . is now owned by companies other than the utilities that once enjoyed monopolies , stuntz said . " i ' m not sure at the end of the day this really changes all that much , " said william scherman , a former ferc general counsel now with skadden , arps , slate , meagher 202 - 862 - 6647 ; bryan . lee @ dowjones . com copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . enron falls amid concern debt threatens dynegy bid ( update 6 ) 2001 - 11 - 20 16 : 47 ( new york ) enron falls amid concern debt threatens dynegy bid ( update 6 ) ( adds dynegy ' s watson declined to comment on enron filings in final paragraph . ) houston , nov . 20 ( bloomberg ) - - enron corp . shares and bonds dropped after the energy trader disclosed it may have to pay $ 9 . 15 billion in debt due by 2003 , suggesting the company may run out of cash before its takeover by dynegy inc . can be completed . shares of enron fell $ 2 . 05 , or 23 percent , to $ 7 . 01 . earlier they touched $ 6 . 55 , the lowest price in more than a decade . enron ' s 6 . 4 percent notes due in july 2006 were bid as low as 69 cents on $ 1 of face value and offered at 73 cents , down more than 13 percent , traders said . enron , whose dealings with affiliated partnerships led to earnings restatements , credit - rating cuts , a federal investigation and a management shakeup , said in a regulatory filing that it has less than $ 2 billion in cash or credit lines . dynegy plans to complete its buyout by october , and enron may have to ask lenders to restructure payment schedules to survive . ` ` this filing shows that enron is in a precarious financial situation , ' ' said commerzbank securities analyst andre meade , who rates enron shares ` ` hold ' ' and doesn ' t own them . ` ` they have to stay afloat for the dynegy deal to go through , and that now looks difficult .

' s salomon smith barney lobbied the credit - rating company , people familiar with the situation said . avoiding junk a junk rating would have led dynegy to abandon the acquisition , dynegy chief executive officer charles watson said . it would also have triggered debt repayment of at least $ 3 . 9 billion , enron said in a securities & exchange commission filing yesterday . enron shares are selling for almost 32 percent less than the value of dynegy ' s offer , showing investors have doubts the deal will be completed . dynegy shares fell $ 1 . 90 to $ 41 . 70 today . ` ` it ' s become more clear that the chances of this deal going through aren ' t 90 percent , but much closer to fifty - fifty , ' ' said edward paik , who helps manage the liberty utilities fund , with 1 . 6 million enron shares . ` ` there ' s just so much information that is unknowable ' ' about enron ' s financial position , he said . most of the $ 9 . 15 billion in debt is due before the end of the third quarter of 2002 , when the dynegy buyout is scheduled to close , enron said yesterday in a filing with the sec . asset sales planned last week , enron chief operating officer greg whalley said the company will sell assets of ` ` non - core businesses ' ' to raise money . it has $ 8 billion invested in the businesses , including broadband telecommunications and the dabhol power plant in india . enron expects to get ` ` billions ' ' from the sales , whalley said , without being more specific . enron reported yesterday that its u . s . operations had $ 1 . 2 billion in cash left . it has added at least $ 5 billion since sept . 30 from credit lines , loans and a $ 1 . 5 billion investment from chevrontexaco , part owner of dynegy . enron used $ 1 . 9 billion of the money it raised to retire commercial paper , which is short - term debt . it gave no details on how it spent the remaining $ 3 . 1 billion . enron chief financial officer jeffrey mcmahon said last week that the company also was looking to get another $ 500 million to $ 1 billion from private investors . asset sales valued at about $ 800 million are expected to close by the end of this year , according to the sec filing . enron spokeswoman karen denne wouldn ' t comment on whether it could sell assets fast enough to keep current on its debts . dynegy will have to help enron sell assets , said mitchell stapley , who manages $ 3 . 5 billion in fixed - income assets including enron bonds for fifth third investment advisors inc . dynegy and chevrontexaco corp . , which owns 26 percent of dynegy , also will have to help enron negotiate with its lenders , said kathleen vuchetich , who helps manage the $ 1 . 4 billion strong american utilities fund , which is 5 percent dynegy shares . debt questioned ` ` i never dreamt ( the $ 9 . 15 billion ) would be that large , coming due all at once , ' ' vuchetich said . ` ` it calls into question their decision to schedule it that way in the first place . ' ' chevrontexaco , the second - largest u . s . oil company , is providing $ 2 . 5 billion in cash as part of the enron buyout . it provided the first $ 1 . 5 billion a week ago . in exchange for that investment , dynegy will get a pipeline valued at more than $ 2 billion if the enron purchase is not completed . shares of chevrontexaco , based in san francisco , rose $ 3 . 62 to $ 86 . 53 . enron yesterday reduced third - quarter results by 3 cents a share , bringing the period ' s loss to 87 cents , or $ 664 million . on nov . 8 , enron lowered earnings back to 1997 by $ 586 million to reflect losses by affiliated partnerships that were wrongly kept off the books . that included a third - quarter reduction of $ 17 million . a drop in enron ' s senior unsecured debt rating to ` ` bbb - ' ' by standard & poor ' s on nov . 12 may force enron to pay off a $ 690 million note by nov . 27 if it doesn ' t find collateral to guarantee the debt taken on by an affiliated partnership that owns brazilian natural - gas assets , the filing said . without repayment or collateral , investors can begin to liquidate the partnership ' s assets , enron said . the company said it ' s working with lenders to come up with an acceptable agreement on the debt . making good on debt owed by its whitewing affiliated partnership may cut enron ' s fourth - quarter earnings , enron said . enron is obligated to back whitewing by issuing junior convertible preferred stock . because enron ' s stock has plunged , it may have to write down its assets by $ 700 million , the filing said . dynegy ' s watson said when the enron buyout was announced that he was convinced enron ' s trading operations are sound , and he called disclosure about financial partnerships such as whitewing as ` ` financial noise . ' ' he declined a request to comment today on enron ' s latest filings , dynegy spokeswoman jennifer rosser said . enron bbb - rating on creditwatch negative - s & p 11 / 20 / 2001 afx news ( c ) 2001 by afp - extel news ltd new york ( afx ) - standard & poor ' s said its ' bbb - minus ' and " a - 3 " ratings for enron corp will remain on creditwatch with negative implications , which is one notch above junk status after the ailing energy group warned it may have to pay off a 690 mln usd note next week . in a statement , the rating agency also said enron ' s near - term liquidity position is " expected to be sufficient " to enable it to merge with dynegy inc , in a deal scheduled to close in the third quarter of 2002 . yesterday , enron warned that it faces heavy debt repayment obligations in less than 10 days , and has reduced its already - reported third - quarter earnings . in a 10 q filing with the securities and exchange commission , enron said that because of a credit rating downgrade last week , it now faces a debt payment of 690 mln usd by nov 27 . enron also said it may have to pay 9 . 15 bln in debt due by 2003 , suggesting the company may run out of cash before its takeover by dynegy can be completed . the group also restated its third - quarter earnings , lowering them by 3 cents per share . lwl / gc for more information and to contact afx : www . afxnews . com and www . afxpress . com copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved .

Subject: fw : sundance b bid from duke we feel that selling at the levels below would be stupid . we ' ll keep searching for a better bid . - - - - - original message - - - - - from : davies , derek sent : thursday , september 20 , 2001 4 : 27 pm to : lavorato , john ; kitchen , louise ; milnthorp , rob cc : miller , don ( asset mktg ) ; zufferli , john subject : sundance b bid from duke john / louise / rob : i thought i would fire off a quick note to inform you that duke produced a non - binding bid for the entire sundance b ppa . duke ' s bid is c $ 180 , 000 , 000 . this compares to an earlier bid of c $ 120 , 000 , 000 to c $ 140 , 000 , 000 for one unit on july 10 , 2001 . duke ' s bid combined with the cost structure of the ppa would have duke buying the ppa for approximately c $ 35 . 50 / mw or us $ 22 . 50 / mw . the mark - to - market value of both the sundance units as of september 18 th ' s curves was c $ 178 , 120 , 374 . therefore , a sale to duke at c $ 180 mm would not provide any significant increase to earnings . additionally , it must be noted that the curves have some very conservative heat rate assumptions built into to the latter years . based on a conversation with john last week , he clearly indicated that selling the ppa for under us $ 25 . 00 / mw is not acceptable . i would agree with john that enron would better be served by maintaining its current position than accept a bid reflecting a price less than us $ 25 . 00 . it must be noted that duke ' s bid expires at 5 : 00 pm cdt , september 21 . therefore , if anyone feels strongly that we should move forward with duke we should address it immediately . otherwise , don miller and i continue to position enron for the division of the ppa and subsequent auction . derek
Subject: summary - judge ' s recommendation re retroactive refunds commenting on his general perception of the settlement conference , the chief judge , in his down home manner , did not miss the opportunity to say that " you can take a horse to water but you can ' t make him drink . " below is a cliff notes version of the judge ' s report and recommendation issued at 4 : 49 pm today . attached is the complete work . the judge opined that very large refunds would be due - " while the amount of such refunds is not $ 8 . 9 billion as claimed by the state of california , they do amount to hundreds of millions of dollars , probably more than a billion dollars in an aggregate sum . ? at the same time , while there are vast sums due for overcharges , there are even larger amounts owed to energy sellers by the caiso , the investor owned utilities , and the state of california . can a cash refund be required where a much larger amount is due the seller ? the chief judge thinks not . " another notable quote : " ? it is the opinion of the chief judge that the amount claimed by the state of california has not and cannot be substantiated . " the judge noted that he submitted a proposal of his own on july 5 , which was summarily rejected by the state of california , and that the five separate offers of the various industry groups to settle with california were also rejected . refund effective date - refund effective date of october 2 , 2000 , for sales in the spot markets of the caiso and the cal px . the chief judge ' s recommendations do not go beyond that date . " spot market " sales are " sales that are 24 hours or less and that are entered into the day of or day prior to delivery . " evidentiary hearing - " the differences between what the state of california believes the buyers in the california markets are owed in refunds and what the sellers in the california market believe should be refunded raise material issues of fact . the appropriate numbers to calculate potential refunds involve factual disputes . thus , the chief judge recommends that a trial - type , evidentiary hearing be ordered limited to a factual record to apply to the methodology set forth below . because of the urgent need for an answer to the refund issues that hearing should be on a 60 - day fast track schedule . it is important that a single methodology be adopted for calculating potential refunds in this proceeding . however , such a methodology may not be appropriate for all sellers in the caiso ' s and cal px ' s spot markets in an after - the - fact refund calculation . in any event , sellers not using the methodology should bear the burden of demonstrating that their costs exceeded the results of the methodology recommended herein over the entire refund period . " methodology - the chief judge recommends that the methodology set forth in the june 19 th order be used with the modifications discussed below in order to calculate any potential refunds that may be due to customers in the caiso ' s and cal px ' s spot energy and ancillary service markets for the period october 2 , 2000 through may 28 , 2001 . heat rate - the actual heat rates , rather than hypothetical heat rates ( associated with recreating the must - bid requirement of the june 19 th order ) provide the first step in calculating the cost of the marginal unit . gas cost - the gas costs associated with the marginal unit should be based upon a daily spot gas price . " in the event that the marginal unit is located in npl 5 ( north of path 15 ) , the daily spot gas price for pg & e citygate and malin should be averaged with the resulting gas price multiplied by the marginal unit ' s heat rate to calculate a clearing price for that hour . if the marginal unit is located in spl 5 ( south of path 15 ) , the daily spot gas price for southern california gas large packages should be multiplied by the marginal unit ' s heat rate to calculate a clearing price for that hour . the daily spot gas prices should be for the " midpoint " as published in financial times energy ' s " gas daily " publication for the aforementioned delivery points . the last published gas prices should be used in calculating the refund price for the days that gas daily is not published ( weekends and holidays ) . " o & m adder - an adder of $ 6 / mwh for o & m should also be included with the calculated market clearing price . emissions costs - demonstrable emission costs should be excluded from the market clearing price and treated as an additional expense that sellers may subtract from their respective refund calculation . credit adder - the 10 percent adder should be included in the market clearing price for all transactions that occurred after january 5 , 2001 when pg & e and socal edison were deemed no longer creditworthy . ancillary services - consistent with the june 19 th order , ancillary service prices would be capped at the market clearing price established in the real - time imbalance energy market . adjustment bids would also be treated the same as set forth in the june 19 th order . maximum price for non - emergency hours - somewhat unclear . the chief judge recommends that for purposes of recreating a competitive market for calculating refunds , the refund methodology should deviate from the 85 % non - emergency requirement of the june 19 th order . to measure the amount that actual prices may have exceeded the refund price , every hour should be recalculated . offsets - " recalculating the hourly competitive price for purposes of a refund calculation would also permit the cal px and caiso to resettle all charges for the refund period . amounts owed to sellers and outstanding amounts due from buyers would be recalculated . any refunds could then be offset against accurate amounts receivable without sellers netting out any of their purchases from the caiso and cal px during the refund period . " interest - interest should not be charged against any refund amounts unless the refund amount exceeds the amounts that are past due to the seller .

Subject: the storm arrives - cera alert update from cera on pricing and rest of the season . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - forwarded by lorna brennan / et withdrawal rates decline with inventory as field pressure is reduced . * pressure in the market will be reinforced and extended through 2001 and probably into 2002 . during the past two summers , high prices have been required to discourage demand and allow overall us storage injections to reach barely 1 . 6 trillion cubic feet ( tcf ) . if normal weather holds for the remainder of this winter , 2 . 2 tcf of injections - which would be nearly impossible to achieve - would be required during 2001 if inventories are to recover to 2 . 7 tcf at peak . if weather this winter is merely normal from mid - december through march , going into winter next year the united states will have considerably less gas in storage . reaching even the 2 , 362 bcf level , according to cera estimates ( see table 1 ) , would require an additional 275 bcf of injections next year , and that alone would prove challenging . price - the cold weather path the weakness of storage inventories and the demand pressure in both core and power generation markets created by the cold weather have caused prices to move onto and even above cera ' s cold weather path for this winter ( see table 2 ) . storage inventories would become perilously low if the current forecast for cold weather through mid - december proves accurate , and the injections required next summer would keep pressure in the market intense . for these reasons cera ' s outlook for prices for january and throughout 2001 now reflects the cold weather path . prices could take an even higher path , particularly if colder - than - normal weather endures beyond mid - december or returns on a sustained basis in january or february . several forces that could weaken prices during 2001 will begin to enter the market during the winter , but these are offset by demand volatility in the winter and the requirement to rebuild storage inventories once the winter is over . such factors include a building us supply capability , growing imports , softening oil prices ( allowing a lower floor for prices once the winter ends ) , and potentially weakening economic growth . although the influence of these factors will increase , it is unlikely to match the huge injection requirement that appears more and more certain next summer . demand - the difficult next round of switching with gas prices hitting new record highs , cera expects some additional demand to be priced out of the market . because gas has priced above residual fuel oil for most weeks since may , however , the easiest fuel switching in the power generation and industrial sectors has already occurred . even though gas prices are currently above the level of distillate ( approximately $ 7 . 23 per mmbtu in new york ) , switching from gas to distillate requires changes in long - standing consumer habit , will occur only over time , and is likely limited in volume . significant switching to distillate would quickly raise the price of distillate itself . there are four major sources of additional demand response in industrial markets : * additional switching to resid in industrial boilers . the next increment of demand to come out of the market is likely to be in the industrial sector , through additional fuel switching to resid ( and to some extent to distillate ) . these markets will continue to show some flexibility but will not represent a large volume . cera estimates that the industrial boiler market has probably already begun to lose small amounts ( less than 0 . 5 bcf per day ) in switching to resid , given the consistency of gas price premiums greater than $ 0 . 50 per mmbtu . * investment in restoring switching capability . as premiums move far beyond this level , industrial end users can be expected to take a closer look at reinvigorating their switching capability beyond their initial short - term levels . however , such a change would require investment by industrial end users and the availability of resid in oil markets . cera estimates that with focused investment over the course of a number of months to perhaps a year , switching to resid could eventually reach as high as 1 . 3 bcf per day . there is already some movement here ; given the impact of high gas prices on earnings , energy prices have already begun to receive management attention . * switching to distillate . us department of energy data suggest that industrial end users have a theoretical capability of switching nearly 1 . 3 bcf per day to distillate in the short term . this switch would represent additional distillate demand of over 200 , 000 barrels per day ( bd ) in a us market of 3 . 8 million barrels . this marginal demand would move the distillate price in tandem with gas price , and any additional switching among power generators to distillate would reinforce this price correlation . in addition , the availability of distillate inventories on site should restrict the quick switching to short periods of time and will not offer a long - term solution to tight markets . * shutting down industrial plants . also offering some flexibility is the shutdown of manufacturing plants that use gas as a feedstock . the major feedstock consumers are the ammonia and methanol industries , and , not surprisingly given the tight margins available , manufacturers of ammonia and of methanol continue to show suppressed gas demand . however , in the short term only a portion of ammonia production is at risk . whereas the production needs of merchant facilities along the gulf coast is relatively readily replaced by imports , substitution becomes more difficult away from the coast ( because of transportation logistics ) and for facilities whose production is linked to value - added fertilizer products . hence , cera still estimates that even with nonexistent margins , substantial ammonia production would continue , with additional losses of perhaps 200 million cubic feet ( mmcf ) per day of potential demand in addition to the facilities that have already closed . extraordinarily high gas prices will also hasten the shuttering of north american methanol capacity , putting at risk another 100 to 200 mmcf per day of gas demand for that sector . switching that could occur in boiler use is concentrated in the chemicals , paper , and refining sectors in the south and the food products sector in the midwest . continuing feedstock losses would be concentrated in the south central region . for process users , even extraordinarily high gas prices are expected to have little impact on the use of gas in the short term . energy costs are not the dominant component of production costs for these users , and a physical changeover would be time - intensive and elemental in its impact on end - use product quality . the northeast - cold weather operations begin all of the northeast pipelines have issued notices to customers that they either have imposed , or are highly likely to need to impose , transportation restrictions of various types . the most common restriction is to nonprimary firm services ( secondary and interruptible type services ) , which will be scheduled for the next several days on many pipelines . other pipelines have issued balancing requirements whereby receipts and deliveries must match . even hourly flow orders have also been implemented . these actions are normal for winter operations when a cold period is expected . whereas the firm market for natural gas is rarely affected by these restrictions , the spot market becomes much more volatile as interruptible supplies dry up . the spot market , primarily made up of nonfirm customers , has had a dramatic reaction to the diminished availability of delivered spot gas into the market area , as has been reflected by the volatility of the cash market this week . the result of these restrictions of nonprimary firm services has been an expansion of basis to henry hub . at one point , gas for next - day delivery to new york traded near $ 24 . 00 per mmbtu delivered , although the average price was closer to $ 14 . 20 . these high spikes are the result of very thinly traded volumes of gas . although these restrictions will likely ease as temperatures return closer to normal , cera now expects basis into the new york citygate to average $ 1 . 31 per mmbtu for december and $ 1 . 36 per mmbtu for january . * * end * * follow url for pdf version of this alert with associated tables . come shoot the rapids with us at ceraweek 2001 , " shooting the rapids : strategies and risks for the energy future " in houston , february 12 - 16 , 2001 ! for more information and to register , please visit http : / / www . cera . com / ceraweek / this electronic message and attachments , if any , contain information from cambridge energy research associates , inc .

Subject: wind i like wind . i have two people pursuing opportunities . elliot mainzer and scott healy . elliot managed our structuring group and has been interested in renewables for some time so tim and i pushed him out of his nest and gave him a mandate to start a renewables desk . his vision is to make a market for green power and start a renewables power exchange ( " rpx " ) on eol . scott is a generalist originator but developed wind projects prior to joining enron so i have pulled him in to work with elliot . in this high - priced market , wind is economic . wind development is able to come online quicker than nat gas . the challenges are related to firming , or at least being able to pre - schedule the energy . bpa , pacificorp and ladwp have expressed interest in taking intermittent wind energy and redelivering it to a market point with a weekly pre - schedule . they charge approximately $ 10 / mwh for this service . given the value of supply , we are trying to buy energy or partner in development . current supply initiatives : - executed mou with enexco / cinergy for joint development - non - binding , epmi markets , enexco builds and operates ; cinergy provides equity - proposed to pacificorp purchase of 50 mw block from their stateline project - proposed to ene wind purchase of energy from four of their ca projects - proposed to ene wind the purchase of one of their pnw sites - discussions with morongo tribe re joint ca development demand is coming from municipal and investor utilities , bpa , dwr , select fortune 50 industrials with green portfolio requirements . bpa put out an rfp for 1000 mw . we are meeting with municipal utilities to promote the concept of the rpx and to get some notional long - term bids . this has all heated up in the last two months , but i like the fundamentals and i think we will have a small , profitable new business by the end of the year . chris louise kitchen 04 / 03 / 2001 02 : 05 pm to : christopher f calger / pdx / ect @ ect cc : subject : re : turbine swap i like the innovative approach to ge . what are you doing on wind by the way ? louise christopher f calger 04 / 02 / 2001 07 : 39 pm to : louise kitchen / hou / ect @ ect cc : subject : turbine swap we received two financing commitment letters from hancock . in general , the letters are good and suggest that hancock is genuinely in the deal , but they include some flakey language about not having final committee approvals . chip is going to push them a little more and if necessary get hancock to call ben glisan to assure us that they are in ( hancock wants a lot of future business from enron ) . in the meantime , we are innovatively stalling ge by requiring some consent language up front so we get another day from them . i think we will get both sides of this trade done .

Subject: california update 5 / 09 please contact kristin walsh ( 713 ) 853 - 9510 or britt whitman ( 713 ) 345 - 4014 for questions . executive summary ? california ' s bond inevitability ? davis faces even greater financial woes ? california ' s creditor status debated by court ? windfall profits tax bill ( sb lx / ab 128 x ) passes senate vote , davis expected to sign off california bond battle sb 31 x passed the senate today by a simple majority vote , initiating the 90 day wait period on the revenue bonds issuance . sources indicate that contrary to media reports , a possible referendum on the sb 31 x would be unlikely for harvey rosenfield to produce within 90 days due to insufficient funding . he reportedly would need to raise $ 250 , 000 - $ 500 , 000 very quickly . sources believe that it is more likely that harvey will attempt to set up an initiative later this year or in 2002 . davis financial woes just beginning it is unclear whether governor davis truly will be able to move money around within the state budget to cover power purchases until august . of the $ 13 . 4 billion bond amount authorized , approximately $ 6 . 7 billion has already been spent on power . it is likely that the state will spend more than the remaining $ 6 . 7 billion on power before the bonds are even issued . sources indicate that most of the long - term contracts davis talks about are unsigned and not really in place . this means that the state may still have to purchase the majority of power on the spot market , which further complicates the situation . as reported earlier , this explains why the republicans wanted to wait for davis to disclose the terms of the contracts before authorizing the bond issuance . given the lack of contracts in place , it appears that the bridge loan and the bonds will be inadequate for all of the state ' s power purchases . " to be or not to be , " is california a creditor ? sources indicate that lawyers and members of the generator community reviewing california ' s revenue bond bill sb 31 x , are unclear as to whether the state of california has claims as a creditor . it appears at this time , that the assembly re - wrote senator bowen ' s language so that the bill relies on the existing interpretation of ab lx as to when the state gets paid by the utilities . this exact issue is currently being reviewed in the pg & e bankruptcy case and will most likely settle this ongoing dispute between legislatures and utilities . windfall profits tax according to sources , the windfall profits tax bill , sb lx , still remains in committee in the assembly . it is unclear if this bill could be brought to a vote tomorrow given that each house has not reviewed the other ' s version of the bill . sources further indicate that the senate version sb lx , has not yet been referred to an assembly policy committee and that a " significant reconciliation process " between the two bills must occur . for example , unlike the senate version , the assembly version reportedly does not set a price cap based on a firm dollar amount , but instead leaves the decision up to a regulatory committee such as the puc . once the bond issuance passes the senate and is officially authorized , the state will likely be able to get its bridge loan from the lenders . however , sources indicate that the bridge loan is " dead " unless the senate moves before thursday .

bo and vince will be in houston in late august for a nymex cocktail party at rocc and i could arrange a meeting at enron .

Subject: california update 7 / 25 / 01 - - - - meeting w / assembly on its latest version of edison mou adding to kristin ' s update , here ' s the summary of a meeting that just occured with assembly leadership staff and industry on the assembly ' s latest version of an " edison mou " : the speaker ' s staffer said that if he had to bet at this time , he would bet that the assembly would not convene on friday . he also said that , if it doesn ' t happen on friday , nothing will happen until they get back from recess on the 20 th of august . the assembly will let folks know by tonight or first thing tomorrow whether they intend to move forward with a vote on friday or recess . from the most recent proposal released today by the assembly leadership , it appears that the centrist democrats are prevailing . the proposal : retains direct access ( though they said that they are continuing to be pressured by the treasurer , who wants da suspended due to the bond issuance ) places 80 % of edison ' s past debt with large customers ( leaving 20 % with small customers , which business customers or strenuously opposing ) . eliminates all references to any purchase , or option to purchase , edison ' s transmission . ( they said there simply ain ' t the votes to buy , or consider buying , edison ' s transmission in the assembly ) maintains the senate provision , which would pay the banks , pay the qfs , but place with edison the risk of figuring out how to pay the $ 1 billion owed to suppliers . ( even the munis are begining to complain about those provisions . ) creates a tradeable , renewable portfolio standard ( conceptually similar to the one created in texas ) . the new bill is created by 1 ) amending sb 78 and 2 ) gutting a different bill passed from the senate to the assembly , sb 39 , and replacing it with the new version of 82 xx . the two would go together to create the assembly ' s newest proposal . if this bill gets voted out of the assembly , it will likely have a difficult time getting the votes necessary to pass in the senate , since the senate has considered and rejected several provisions currently included in the assembly version . will report back on whether the assembly ' s going forward or adjourning for recess as soon as we hear . best , jeff - - - - - forwarded by jeff dasovich / na / enron on 07 / 25 / 2001 06 : 26 pm - - - - - kristin walsh / enron @ enronxgate 07 / 25 / 2001 04 : 30 pm to : john j lavorato / enron @ enronxgate , louise kitchen / enron @ enronxgate , david w delainey / hou / ees @ ees cc : christopher f calger / enron @ enronxgate , christian yoder / enron @ enronxgate , steve c hall / enron @ enronxgate , mike swerzbin / enron @ enronxgate , phillip k allen / enron @ enronxgate , jeff dasovich / na / enron @ enron , chris gaskill / enron @ enronxgate , mike grigsby / enron @ enronxgate , tim heizenrader / enron @ enronxgate , vince j kaminski / enron @ enronxgate , steven j kean / enron @ enronxgate , rob milnthorp / enron @ enronxgate , kevin m presto / enron @ enronxgate , claudio ribeiro / enron @ enronxgate , richard shapiro / enron @ enronxgate , james d steffes / enron @ enronxgate , mark tawney / enron @ enronxgate , scott tholan / enron @ enronxgate , britt whitman / enron @ enronxgate , lloyd will / enron @ enronxgate , alan comnes / enron @ enronxgate , rogers herndon / enron @ enronxgate , james w lewis / hou / ees @ ees , don black / hou / ees @ ees , kelly holman / enron @ enronxgate , mark dana davis / hou / ect @ ect , fletcher j sturm / enron @ enronxgate , doug gilbert - smith / enron @ enronxgate , richard b sanders / enron @ enronxgate , andrew edison / enron @ enronxgate , kelly holman / enron @ enronxgate , nancy turner / enron @ enronxgate , tim belden / enron @ enronxgate , john brindle / enron @ enronxgate , david cromley / enron @ enronxgate subject : california update 7 / 25 / 01 p . 3 details are still rough and the situation is very fluid , but here is what is currently going on : senators hertzberg and keeley are amending both sb 78 xx and ab 82 xx . upon an initial read , it appears that they are doing the following : ? ab 82 xx has been gutted except for the direct access provisions and the renewables portfolio . ( the core / non - core business provisions , the transmission asset purchase , etc . all appear to have been deleted . ) both of these provisions that have been left in the bill were seen as positive by members last week when the bill was first debated . ? it appears amendments have been made to sb 78 xx but the extent of these changes are not yet known . ? at the beginning of both amended bills , it states , " as proposed to be amended into sb _ xx . " this means that amendments to sb 78 could be incorporated into ab 82 , and vice versa . another possibility is an entirely new bill .
Subject: re : tech services louise , i ' m ok with that arrangement , without the dotted line reporting relationship between the members of the ena tech services group and the wholesale group . otherwise , my role is somewhat superfluous and cloudy at best . we can still achieve the same result by brian and i working together . brian louise kitchen 03 / 15 / 2001 09 : 55 am to : brian redmond / hou / ect @ ect cc : subject : re : tech services but isn ' t the point that its only a dotted line just like joe deffner has a dotted line to andy fastow . i can ' t see them as getting worried over a dotted line . i notice the one alternative you have not mentioned is leaving it as it is today with it all reporting to you and you managing any relationship with brian - what do you think ? louise brian redmond 03 / 14 / 2001 09 : 16 pm to : louise kitchen / hou / ect @ ect cc : subject : tech services louise , i had a brief chat with mark regarding his plans for enron wholesale tech services . as i understand him , he sees the ena tech services group reporting into brian stanley on a dotted line basis in order to keep these groups coordinated . you may want to first discuss / sell this reporting relationship with the origination units who will fear another ee & cc . further , we will have to sell this organizational structure to the members of the ena tech services group . i ' m concerned that we may loose some of our top engineers who will resist being organizationally tied to eas . two possible alternative arrangements : 1 . the ena tech services group remains as ena ' s development engineering organization . it should be regionalized and report ( on a solid line ) to the origination groups . this will keep the ena tech services group lean and mean and somewhat independent from the wholesale tech services group : a ) bob virgo / mike coleman would report into presto / durhan , b ) wayne mayes and his team would report into calger . c ) mike coleman would report into max and would help support esa , d ) nick cocavessis would support the gas and liquids businesses e ) ron blackham would support enron south america brian stanley ' s group would be seen as a technical resource base to draw from , and as a " friendly " check on the technical assumptions that are used in the pro formas . brian stanley ' s group would provide a review of enron america ' s dash ' s so as to keep the ena tech services group from becoming too aggressive in its assumptions ( whereas brian ' s group will tend to be over - conservative in its role as risk manager ) . 2 . another alternative is to create a broader role for the commercial investment / asset management group that you , dick and i spoke about . this unit would combine the skill sets of the restructuring group and the tech services group . it would have the technical responsibility for ena transactions throughout their life cycle and would have commercial responsibility for investments and assets that no longer have strategic or ongoing financial value to the origination groups . specifically : a ) investments and assets that were not projected to earn their cost of capital b ) investments and assets that had little or no strategic value c ) troubled assets / positions / investment that required significant time / attention beyond what the origination groups were willing to spend as with suggestion ( 1 . ) above , this group would use brian stanley ' s organization as a resource base to draw from on an as needed basis , however , there would not be a formal reporting relationship . lets discuss , brian

Subject: deal confirmation changes good afternoon ron , we just had a meeting with bill williams , head of real - time trading in portland , to discuss some problems we are having with the real - time deals flowing to the deal confirmation system . currently , the deal confirmation system is pulling the term information so that changes made by real - time to reflect actual volumetric flow & price are not seen by the confirmation groups . one possible solution has already been examined and that would be to have the real - time traders use deal entry to make all the changes . this solution will not work . if the real - time guys start changing the deals in deal entry , the original negotiated deal will be lost . also , and more importantly , the time to make all the changes for the real - time adjustments in deal entry would make it impossible to keep up with the high volume of deals we are now seeing . thanks , david poston it manager , portland

Subject: enron europe organisational changes once the arcos plant in spain is financially closed ( expected in q 2 of this year ) eric gonzales will be moving back to houston to work exclusively on co - managing enron ' s lng markets . we are very appreciative of eric ' s efforts in europe since early 1998 and look forward to continuing to work very closely with his lng team in the coming years . from this point forward eric will focus his remaining time in europe exclusively on financially closing arcos . we are therefore making the following changes immediately . the origination responsibility for italy will be moved under eric shaw . ricardo bortolloti will continue in the role as italian country manager and will report to eric shaw . mariano gentilini will become our country manager for spain and portugal and will report directly to the enron europe office of the chairman . the arcos power project is likely to create a large gas to power spread position and so we have asked paul mead to assume the added responsibility for our natural gas risk positions in spain . this position is much more likely to be supplied and influenced by lng rather than continental gas markets and paul will work quite closely with both enron global markets and the continental gas team . ross sankey who has been managing our marketing efforts in holland will also head a new organization that will focus on subsea interconnector and power transmission opportunities across europe . among the prospects his team will pursue include projects from norway to the uk , sweden to the continent , and bidding on existing french interconnector capacity . he will report to eric shaw for the holland markets and to richard lewis for the transmission responsibilities . finally the continental gas team is interacting far more with our uk gas team than our power teams on the continent . therefore david galagher who manages our continental gas team will now report directly to richard lewis . we have aggressive income targets for this year and anticipate that these changes will create the right links to optimize our performance . please help make these changes as smooth as possible . john sherriff michael brown

Subject: a & a math majors vince , thank you so much for meeting with me friday morning about the research group . after leaving your office , i remembered an issue i have had with the analyst & associate program that might be of interest to you . during a texas a & m recruiting meeting , i learned that we have expanded our list of majors to include computer science . i wondered why math majors were not mentioned , and was told that there was not a business need for math majors . like liberal arts majors , they said math majors were only considered on a person by person basis . in my opinion , math majors have many of the same skills as finance majors , and can easily adjust to accounting rotations as well ( i did last summer , and finance majors in the program are forced to every year . ) i think that enron is missing out on many qualified candidates by limiting their recruitment effort . at texas a & m the career center asks companies for a list of majors they are targeting , and only allows those majors to sign up for interviews through the career center . i sent my resume to enron and asked to be included in the interview process on campus . however , many other math majors had not heard of enron or the other companies , and assumed that there was no place for a math major at a company like enron . many math majors want to continue their education , become teachers , or work for an actuarial firm . however , many are undecided . we are constantly told of the many business possibilities available to math majors by our teachers and staff , but many undergraduates are still not sure exactly what math majors can contribute in a business environment . by not mentioning math majors to the career center ( a very simple and inexpensive step ) , enron is losing out on a very talented pool of people . while it would be nice to get the math majors that knew about enron already , had thoroughly researched all companies and determined that math majors would fit perfectly , and went the extra step to send enron their resume outside the career center system , there are many qualified students who do not do this , and opt for other companies who did mention math majors . i called a manager in the a & a program to suggest that we consider at least mentioning math majors to the career centers . i realize that it may cost more to actively pursue them , talk to teachers , and attend math society events . however , i told her that including them at the career center would be very inexpensive for enron . she reiterated that they saw no business need for math majors , and that if more upper level people began requesting them , it would be considered . i searched for " mathematics " on the enron job website , and had a surprising number of results . i know that your group could use math majors as well . however , this still may be too small a number to merit a focus from the a & a recruiting department . i just wanted to bring it to your attention in case it was something that you felt should be changed . thanks , heather johnson x 53240

Subject: neon retreat ho ho ho , we ' re around to that most wonderful time of the year - - - neon leaders retreat time ! i know that this time of year is extremely hectic , and that it ' s tough to think about anything past the holidays , but life does go on past the week of december 25 through january 1 , and that ' s what i ' d like you to think about for a minute . on the calender that i handed out at the beginning of the fall semester , the retreat was scheduled for the weekend of january 5 - 6 . but because of a youth ministers conference that brad and dustin are connected with that week , we ' re going to change the date to the following weekend , january 12 - 13 . now comes the part you need to think about . i think we all agree that it ' s important for us to get together and have some time to recharge our batteries before we get to far into the spring semester , but it can be a lot of trouble and difficult for us to get away without kids , etc . so , brad came up with a potential alternative for how we can get together on that weekend , and then you can let me know which you prefer . the first option would be to have a retreat similar to what we ' ve done the past several years . this year we could go to the heartland country inn ( www . . com ) outside of brenham . it ' s a nice place , where we ' d have a 13 - bedroom and a 5 - bedroom house side by side . it ' s in the country , real relaxing , but also close to brenham and only about one hour and 15 minutes from here . we can golf , shop in the antique and craft stores in brenham , eat dinner together at the ranch , and spend time with each other . we ' d meet on saturday , and then return on sunday morning , just like what we ' ve done in the past . the second option would be to stay here in houston , have dinner together at a nice restaurant , and then have dessert and a time for visiting and recharging at one of our homes on that saturday evening . this might be easier , but the trade off would be that we wouldn ' t have as much time together . i ' ll let you decide . email me back with what would be your preference , and of course if you ' re available on that weekend . the democratic process will prevail - - majority vote will rule ! let me hear from you as soon as possible , preferably by the end of the weekend . and if the vote doesn ' t go your way , no complaining allowed ( like i tend to do ! ) have a great weekend , great golf , great fishing , great shopping , or whatever makes you happy ! bobby

Subject: re : hello from vince kaminski at enron vince , thank you for forwarding the following messages . i am sorry that i am just now getting back to you , my lotus notes was down all afternoon yesterday . we currently have the cal berkeley general presentation set for wednesday , october 18 th at 7 : 00 p . m . which works out well because it is just prior to the time deadline for students to submit their resumes . the general presentation is a general overview of enron , the program , the interview process , as well as a chance for students to meet and chat with enron reps . since this is the first year that we are recruiting from cal berkeley , i think that it is important that i attend this event on campus so that i can answer any interview process questions . i will check the schedule and see if it is possible to move the presentation to the 23 rd . the only negative is that i will not be able to attend because i will be conducting interviews at rice that day . also , it is very difficult to find a location to hold the presentation , and i need to check on location availability on the 23 rd . however , i do think that we should take advantage of the seminar on campus . this may mean that they are two seperate trips to campus . perhaps , we can also set up some other presentations for the 23 rd or even the monday prior . although i would like to be able to attend the class / seminar presentations , i don ' t think that it is as vital as the general presentation . what are your thoughts ? thanks , ashley vince j kaminski @ ect 08 / 24 / 2000 08 : 58 am to : " shmuel oren " cc : vince j kaminski / hou / ect @ ect , ashley baxter / corp / enron @ enron subject : re : hello from vince kaminski at enron shmuel , thanks for the message . i am working with our recruiter , ashley baxter , to finalize the date of the trip . i shall shoot for october the 23 rd if this date works for the rest of our team . vince " shmuel oren " on 08 / 23 / 2000 11 : 46 : 19 am to : vince j kaminski / hou / ect @ ect cc : subject : re : hello from vince kaminski at enron dear vince . i sent you a reply earlier this month but i haven ' t heard from you about the date of your visit . our department has a seminar every monday . if you can schedule your visit on a monday i would like to invite you to give a seminar which will be attended by many of our graduate students and faculty and will give you an opportunity to tell them about your program . with sufficient lead - time i can advertise the seminar in the hass school to their financial engineering students . shmuel . shmuel s . oren , professor dept . of industrial engineering and operations research 4117 etcheverry hall university of california berkeley , ca 94720 - 1777 e - mail : oren @ ieor . berkeley . edu phone : ( 510 ) 642 - 1836 or 5484 fax : ( 510 ) 642 - 1403 - - - - - original message - - - - - from : to : ; ; sent : tuesday , august 08 , 2000 10 : 59 am subject : hello from vince kaminski at enron > shmuel , > > i hope you remember me . i visited you together with aram sogomonian , a > good friend of mine , a few years ago . i am currently responsible , among > other things , for recruiting graduates with finance and / or technical > backgrounds at the university of berkeley . i would be glad to give you a > call and talk more about the details of our program . my colleague , > ashleybaxter , from the analyst / associate program at enron would join me > as well . > > i am sending you a copy of the brochure about the analyst / associate > program . > > vince kaminski > > > vincent kaminski > managing director - research > enron corp . > 1400 smith street > room ebl 962 > houston , tx 77002 - 7361 > > phone : ( 713 ) 853 3848 > fax : ( 713 ) 646 2503 > e - mail : vkamins @ enron . com >

Subject: hi from texas hi bill , sorry i haven ' t been alive earlier but it ' s been busy , busy here too . after leaving portland we went to ny for a few days and we got here in houston during the weekend of the flood but we were lucky not to get any of that . in fact i was suprised when i saw the news the next morning . first thing , i checked my past paychecks and you were correct , i have been receiving the 10 % extra for shift work . i apologize for bringing it up in our meeting as i did not know anything about it . i did not receive any explanation that i was going to get it for shift work and i never check my paychecks in detail anyway . thanks for sitting with me in that meeting too . i had a good time working in real time . work here is fine . it is a new market that enron is exploring , that of paper and pulp and trading is fairly thin . i do market analysis for pulp traders and it includes intensive news - reading and passing on important info and gathering of the data and compiling spreadsheets , creating graphs and so on . i like it a lot , i take a lot of the reading home . i get to do some travelling too both in the us and overseas , and i like that too . i like the people in my group and they help me when i don ' t know stuff . one good thing about being here is that there are a lot of classes offered and i am going to be in some of them . texas is different for sure but we like it . yes it is hot but i feel like home . we have been out a bit and went to dallas last weekend to visit some cousins . there is a lot of spanish around here , you hear it everywhere so i decided to learn it and i am going to start it this week , twice a week . it ' s great beacuse when i learn new words i can practice with my latin co - workers . that ' s pretty much it for now . when is evaluation taking place ? how are things there , i bet much busier . let me know , cheers , monika
Subject: anniversary sally - a new idea popped into my head - i don ' t know if it makes things easier - or if everyone would like the idea , but here goes : what if we gathered , as a whole family , for a couple of days , somewhere easy - in texas - like the hill country hyatt , or somehwere in galveston , or the yo ranch or somewhere . we might spend one night or two - plan something fun for the kids , get a big suite where the adults could toast mom and dad with champagne and appetizers - spend time playing games , whatever - just go somewhere easy - and just spend a day or two . then , at that event , we could give mom and dad a gift certificate for a more special ( and far - away ) trip for them - like a four - day weekend in san francisco - or somewhere they ' d really like to go . this would eliminate travel hassles for all of the families involved - but provide us all an opporunity ( albeit condensed ) to get together - and mom and dad would still get to go someplace fun . maybe we could " chip in " varying amounts to mom and dad ' s trip so that cindy and richard could afford it . thoughts ? - cara cara white community development coordinator usta texas section 1 - 888 - 883 - 6388 cwhite @ texas . usta . com

" ferc envisioned the introduction of competition , not only in its jurisdictional ( wholesale ) market . . . but also in the state jurisdictional retail market , and concluded that competition allowed it to expand its jurisdiction in three areas . " first , ferc asserted its jurisdiction over retail transactions when states " unbundled , " or separated , retail rates into charges for delivery and electricity . second , " ferc decided that if a seller of unbundled wholesale energy made use of a local distribution system , ferc - - not the states - - would set the rates that the seller would pay for the use of those . . . facilities , " new york said . third , ferc pre - empted the state ' s authority to set rates to recoup the costs " incurred by utilities to serve retail customers , that may be ' stranded ' ( unrecoverable by utilities ) due to competition , " the state said . the u . s . court of appeals for the d . c . circuit consolidated scores of challenges to the new regulations , including those from nine state commissions , and last june upheld all of ferc ' s actions . several losing parties , including new york , then asked the supreme court for a review . monday , the justices combined the new york case with one brought by energy giant enron power marketing and agreed to hear the case sometime next term . in its own brief to the supreme court on behalf of ferc , the justice department said a section of the federal energy act " explicitly gives ferc jurisdiction over ' all transmission of electric energy in interstate commerce ' and ' all facilities for such transmission ' regardless of whether the transmission is part of a wholesale or retail transaction . " besides , the department argued , a distinction between interstate and intrastate energy may be meaningless . in a 1972 ruling , fpc vs . florida light and 00 - 809 , enron vs . ferc ) by michael kirkland , upi legal affairs correspondent copyright 2001 by united press international . subject code : 02000000

Subject: cpc ' s winter weather prediction for the u . s . climate prediction center winter outlook ? ? ? ? the climate prediction center , a unit of the national oceanic and atmospheric administration , discusses the outlook for this winter . the agency does not expect el nino and la nina to affect global weather for the next nine months . the two weather patterns , which occur because of changes in ocean temperatures in the pacific ocean , directly influence us rain patterns and land temperatures . the cpc says this winter will be the first year in three that the us has not had a strong influence from this particular climate - driving force . but , that does not mean there will be a whole lot of difference in terms of when winter will start . it will have something to do with temperatures , because both la nina and el nino have tended to make temperatures moderate in the winter . ? the cpc expects that this winter nationwide on average will still be slightly warmer than normal , but not as warm as the last three . the northern part of the nation and particularly the northeast , however , could be an exception with colder weather . the warmer pattern will be confined more to the west and the south . east of the mississippi with the exception of florida should be cooler this winter and most of california and the northern half of the rockies and the dakotas . for the fall and winter , expect the southwest to be the mild and dry .

the current procedure is for us to create the product and call dale neuner and let him know its out there . if dale is not in the office , or it is before or after normal work hours , the traders need to call the help desk , who in turn calls amita in the london office who then approves the product . the portland office starts trading at 5 : 00 am ppt . in the event a product is not created ahead of time they create the product in the morning . this morning the traders had several daily products pending approval . it took 45 minutes to get those products approved . on daily products the trading period may last only 1 hour . as a result , the trader missed most of the trading period . our customers are not happy and neither are the traders . a solution was proposed in december , which i have attached below , to address this issue . however , it only works in the ideal world . it would be overly optimistic to think that we are going to be able to always be able to create our products ahead of time . that is not the reality . by rolling out our products we have created an implicate contract with our customers that we will consistently make markets in the products we trade . i would like to propose an alternate solution . we need a direct method for tim belden to have approval rights to approve existing products . these are not new products , we trade them every day . there is no reason tim should not have a level of approval to , at the very least approve existing products . especially where the only change is the term . please call tim belden at 503 - 464 - 3820 or myself at 503 - 464 - 3836 . look forward to hearing from you . regards , mike etringer 503 - 464 - 3836 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - forwarded by dale neuner / hou / ect on 01 / 26 / 2000 07 : 36 am - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - from : donna greif on 12 / 17 / 99 02 : 02 pm to : eol call center cc : product control - houston , enron london - eol product control group / lon / ect @ ect subject : call center - important - please read !

Subject: lessons in hara - kiri , latin version mexico - power strike set for march 16 in mexico city some 35 , 000 members of the mexican union of electrical workers plan to strike the mexico city electric company on friday , march 16 th at 12 noon . the union is demanding a 29 percent salary increase and the company is offering nothing . the two sides are not even talking . the union is concerned that the government may try to force the electrical workers to stay on their jobs or bring in replacements . the union is also opposed to the privatization of the electric company and its leader has charged that privatization would bring higher electric rates to meet the profit demands of foreign investors . the company principally provides electrical service to mexico city and the states of mexico , morelos , hidalgo and puebla . it may be prudent to begin planning for possible power shortages in these regions .

Subject: portland office my name is tim belden and i manage the west power trading desk in portland . louise kitchen suggested that i get in touch with you . i spoke to marcus beurgler on tuesday about the portland office . i indicated to him our desire to move . we discussed an interim period in this office until we can move elsewhere . i learned yesterday that enron has accepted the lease on this office space . i was not aware that this was happening and am told that we are now stuck here for the term of the lease which is three to five years . based on very preliminary assessment it looks like it may be cost effective to move from here . we currently occupy 20 , 000 square feet when we only need roughly 10 , 000 . if we remain in this building there is a significant cost associated with physically separating our phones and computers from portland general electric . everyone here would like to move . what i need to know is the following : is ubs warburg obligated at this point in time to take on the lease for our current space ? if yes , can this be undone ? if no , when will this decision be made ? if we are obligated to take this space , who do i need to talk to within ubs about negotiating with portland general electric to get out of the lease . i have very good relationships with portland general electric so i think that they would work with us on this . i can be reached at 503 - 464 - 3820 or 503 - 701 - 7278 . thanks , tim belden

Subject: re : henwood query hi karolina , yes , it might be more productive to talk on the phone . given our time difference , why don ' t we plan on tomorrow ( friday ) 8 : 00 am pdt , 4 : 00 pm bdt ? my number in the states is 503 - 464 - 8430 . give me your number , too , so that i can call back if i get hung up in a meeting or something . the situation is complicated by the fact that the marginal cost is set by the capacity increment of a plant that is on the margin in a particular hour , but in constructing the stack , increments of a plant may be scattered throughout the stack , based on their respective incremental heat rates . ( this is why increment heat rates must be strictly increasing in this model . ) results for the capacity increments , however , are not available as output ; only each plant ' s aggregate values are reported . i had to construct the stack for a particular hour to answer question about a homer city , ny plant we were studying a few years ago . attached is the sql query you can import into ms access to do the same thing for you ( making appropriate modifications to the year , hour , etc . ) unfortunately , no henwood documentation on the output variables existed when i created this query , so i can not really tell you what they represent anymore . an acquaintance of mine at entergy and i were lobbying to get henwood to provide some documentation , so it may be available now . let ' s talk and maybe we can help you out , michael > > > karolina potter / lon / ect @ enron 08 / 24 / 00 07 : 08 am > > > michael , i am an analyst in paul mead ' s continental power trading group in london . i am currently working on the project , which requires the use of emss , and experience some difficulties interpreting the output results . steven leppard from our research group gave me your name as an expert in this system and consequently the person to contact in case of problems . i have been running simulations for the dutch market and was asked to provide the traders with some front - end screen graphs in order to interpret the numerical results . one of the graphs is to show an hourly generation stack and system ' s marginal cost , as we only run cost based scenarios . to sort each station ' s hourly generation i need its marginal cost . to my knowledge though , marginal cost is only generated for a systems marginal unit ( transarea marginal units query , marg _ cost unit ) . therefore i was sorting the stations according to the cost which i calculated based on the outputs from station detail by hour query . the calculation was as follows : for each hour , for each generating station : " marginal cost " [ o / mwh ] = ( generation _ cost [ oo 00 ] * 1000 ) / generation [ mwh ] - vom _ cost [ o / mwh ] this i thought would include fuel cost and start up costs . however , a marginal station which i get on the stack as a result of the above calculation is not a station given in marginal station field in transarea marginal units query . i have also looked into transarea _ data _ hr table and transarea _ data table but non of the costs there match my results . do you happen to know what formula is used to determine marg _ cost and which outputs i should be using to obtain the right results ? it might be easier if we could discuss this issue on the phone . in this case could you please send me your direct telephone number . i am struggling understanding what is going on and would appreciate your help very much . regards karolina - text . htm - stack generator sql . txt

Subject: origination meeting louise : i unfortunately was not able to attend your meeting this morning as i was interviewing analyst candidates , however the overall reaction from the group seems to be positive and i applaud you for your efforts in setting the tone . i realize the company is in an interesting position with respect to liquidity and therefore i felt compelled to pass this thought by you with respect to a potential avenue power origination could pursue to assist with the current situation . since most of our activities seem to require some amount of capital , i was wondering whether you felt a viable strategy would be to turn carl tricoli ' s prepay concept for ipp ' s on its head and reverse the transaction with one or more counterparties where we pick up the upfront premium and deliver power in the future . assuming we can find the right counterparties , then we in essence would achieve a short position ( which seems to be more in line with your strategic thoughts ) and pick up liquidity in the short run . regards , charlie

Subject: fw : reps / warranties as we discussed this is the proposed solution . . . i may need you to speak to someone at umbrella . . call lance if you have a question - - - - - original message - - - - - from : schuler , lance ( legal ) sent : wednesday , december 19 , 2001 1 : 23 pm to : muller , mark s . ; detmering , tim cc : golden , jeff ; daniels , eddy ; koehler , anne c . ; cook , mary subject : reps / warranties as we have discussed , we are not in a position to commit to convey all properties , assets , rights , etc . that are used in enron ' s current business of trading physical and financial natural gas and electricity and associated risk management products . as the document is currently drafted , all items go , unless specifically excluded . the danger to the estate is that , because the catch - all phrase is so broad , we know now that many items will not be identified , and then cannot be recovered . the sellers will continue their business , subject to the negotiated noncompete ; however , most everything could be deemed to be " used " in the business . the requested reps / warranties apply not just to the assets they are to receive , but to the business stated above . so they are , for example , demanding that we identify and list every employment and consulting agreement pursuant to which someone is performing services in the operation of the business , and each contract with a term of one year or more that has been made in connection with the business , unless relating solely to identified excluded assets . these constructs would pick up literally thousands of other contracts - even confidentiality agreements for example . we propose the following solution : 1 . we have prepared a schedule of specific assets that should be transferred to netco . 2 . we would give a sufficiency rep to assure the buyer that the listed assets are all the material assets necessary for netco to operate a business similar to the business referenced above . we have communicated to the potential buyer that netco would need to attain certain assets , and these would be identified in writing in the rep . for example , certain third - party licenses , and some hardware items . 3 . the rep would have to be tailored to exclude certain items such as office space . 4 . we would give negotiated reps on the specified assets , and in limited , appropriate circumstances on the business . other than the asset list , we would not list all of any specified requirement , but only necessary exceptions to the reps , as negotiated . 5 . we would give a broad " further assurance " covenant to provide , without further cost to netco but subject to any required consents , anything that is later identified as being appropriate for their conducting the business . 6 . we view this as an mbo type transaction involving the sale of assets , whereby the people going to netco know the underlying business best , and can identify specifically the assets that should go , both for the contract to begin with , but also in a very short period of time post - closing ( by using the further assurance clause ) . w . lance schuler enron north america corp . 1400 smith street houston , texas 77002 phone : 713 / 853 - 5419 fax : 281 / 664 - 4890 email : lance . schuler - legal @ enron . com

Subject: sec var gary and georgeanne let me know that all but 487 shares of eog are hedged ( without the eog leg , the cerberus total return swap is really only a loan , and its var is about $ 500 thousand ) . i have recalculated , and the total return swaps var fell to $ 34 million in december and $ 18 million in november . december var is still up substantially from november , and the primary reason now is that since natural gas prices are up so much , the value of the bammel looper and mid texas total return swaps has increased . the more money we make , the more we can potentially lose . regards , eugenio

Subject: caiso notification - ct 1487 - energy exchange program neutrality adjustment energy exchange program neutrality adjustment charge type 1487 sc settlement contacts : background as you may know , the energy exchange program began on trade date 11 / 14 / 2000 . in this program the iso obtained needed energy in for the real time market and , rather that paying for the energy as a purchase , later returned the energy in another period . this was not necessarily a one - for - one exchange . the incoming energy created a positive neutrality adjustment and when the energy was returned , a negative neutrality adjustment ensued . since the incoming and outgoing energy were usually valued differently , there was a cost shift associated with the transaction that was not cash neutral to the iso . the iso created charge type 1487 was developed for the allocation of the cost to scs participating in the market during the incoming schedules notification the iso has created charge type 1487 so that whenever an energy exchange account is closed or reaches a zero balance , the incurred costs will be calculated and allocated to the sc ' s based on their total negative uninstructed energy over those intervals in which the incoming schedules took place . this new charge type will appear beginning on the june 30 , 2001 statements which will be published on august 23 , 2001 . in addition a few accounts reached a zero balance as early as december , 2000 and therefore allocations may or may not appear on your statement with the rerun data . ct 1487 is a semi automated charge , meaning that the collection of energy data is automated , but it will be a manual charge type within the manual line item records and will not require a change to your settlement system . note that this charge will not appear on every statement , but only when an energy exchange account is closed or reaches a zero balance . if you have any questions , please contact your client relations account manager . client relations communication crcommunications @ caiso . com

Subject: west power model lance and i spoke with tim heizenrader regarding modeling work and needs for the west desk . the differences in the markets between east and west are , in tim ' s opinion , sufficient that he does not need an approach as sophisticated as the one we are pursuing for ercot . in particular , the termal limits for which load flows are so useful are not generally binding in the west . loop flows are also not considered a major issue at present . in summary , it seems that the west is an unlikely customer of any extension to an ercot / east transmission model for the time being . they have also done little in this area that would directly relate to our efforts here . martin

( pwc ) was engaged in 10 / 00 to develop a business plan for tactical and strategic solutions for the projected growth in the physical business . in 11 / 00 , aa was engaged to develop a " blueprint " of eim major processes ( deal execution , deal capture , risk management , logistics , settlements and financial reporting ) , down to level 2 processes . the initiatives have been combined into one team focused on delivering the " blueprint " , a gap analysis of enron systems to business needs and recommended systems . a complete " roadmap " should be laid out with a 0 - 3 months , 4 - 6 months , 7 - 9 months and 10 - 12 months timeline . the plan addresses tactical also . our overall objective : build an infrastructure ( people , processes and systems ) that is scalable and supports the trading business of eim . the current industries are forest products and steel . however , additional industries may be added . the targeted infrastructure would require little change to support new industries . the delieverable is expected by the end of 2 / 01 . we ' d be happy to visit with you all ( video conference or houston , . . . . ) to give you more information . let me know how to proceed . thanks again for your time . since i wasn ' t able to attend the controllers ' conference last 10 / 00 , i ' m glad i got to meet you last week . stay in touch . brenda to : brenda f herod / hou / ect @ ect cc : mike jordan / lon / ect @ ect , paul wallace / lon / ect @ ect subject : metals brenda as discussed at our meeting last week there are a few areas of commonality between enron metals and eim that should allow leverage off common goals . in particular i promised info on a few areas : project q assessment a lot of the issues raised in the report are particular to enron metals ( being to do with interfaces with our as 400 ysstem ) however high level issues which formed part of the decision to not develop this for enron metals were : q is over specified for metals . traffic / logistics for metals is less complex than oil & coal . metals process tends towards buy > store > sell whereas for liquids the storage is not as prevelant metals logistics typically involves trucks whereas liquids is ship / barge 2 . inventory controls again the reports produced here have been very specific to enron metals . paul wallace a manager in the co - ordination function is working extensively on developing the controls in this area . i would suggest that you contact paul directly if you wish to discuss specific areas or inventory controls in general . 3 . funding of inventory we have a structured finance facility here in london . the deal is specific to enron metals markets in that it works by reference to lme prices as these are the base index for all the positions placed in the facility . if structured financing is sort for eim then it would be appropriate to talk to either david tregar ( metals commercial ) or bill appleby ( global finance ) as an intro to the issues faced . 4 . curve management process the markets in which our merchanting division trades are based on the lme curves but are linked to a large number of basis curves for quality and location . given the vast number we have opted to break down the markets by brand group and port location . e . g . for copper this means we have a grid with 5 brand groups and 3 sets of port groups ( 13 for europe , 7 for the us and 6 for the far east ) . the maintaince & price testing of the grids is made manageable by the fact the premiums only need be entered for brand and port groups by the traders yet prices can be tested by reference to node points i . e . price of specific brand at a given location which can be checked to a market quote . 5 . re recruitment of paper traders i haven ' t been able to contact him but i recall that the brother of david rosenblum , one of the metals traders in chicago , is a trader of recylced paper . i ' ll keep you posted on long term system development plans here in london . i ' d appreciate same for eim . regards andy

Subject: meetings guys , currently we have two meetings a week between the business unit heads to discuss deal flow and communicate issues and opportunties - the monday morning meeting and the friday managing director meeting . i would suggest that we eliminate both these meetings . i would propose that we replace them with a single friday afternoon meeting from 2 : 30 pm to 4 : 00 pm . the business unit heads identified above would be invited . at this meeting , i would expect less of a reporting focus and employ a more candid and detailed discussion of opportunities , problems and issues between the " partners " in this company . it would include ( i ) a review of current dash ' s , ( ii ) a more detailed discussion around the opportunities identified on the " hot sheet " , ( iii ) a more candid discussion around the p & l and tactics required to meet overall financial targets and ( iv ) provide a forum to provide input into and communicate business strategies between the business units . in other words , employ the goals of the friday managing director meeting with all the business unit leaders represented . given the religious holidays this week , there will be no meeting this friday . i would suggest that we have a regular monday morning meeting next monday and we will start this new forum a week from this friday . this meeting would be held in 30 cl and monterrey , calgary and portland should be connected via video conference . in order for this to work and be effective , the business unit heads need to be available and participate actively in the discussion . if you have questions , comments or concerns do not hesitate to let me know . regards delainey

Subject: re : gas nom ' s we ' ve talked this over at this end and agree we should be taking the following approach : remind brazos that under exhibit 7 . 12 , page 2 of the ppa , brazos is precluded on any gas day from taking a greater volume of gas than the plant ' s mdq ( 45 , 000 dth / d ) less the amount needed to satisfy its generation request . the partnership will accept total gas nominations as generation first , gas for resale second . if brazos ' electric nominations by hour would , given ambient conditions , cause us to use at or above the plant ' s mdq under its contracts with apache / williams ( 45 , 000 dth / d ) , gas nominations will be zero . this needs to be handled between the operators . i ' ve emphasized " at or above " on purpose ; if an all electric nomination would cause brazos to burn in excess of 45 , 000 dth per day , we will honor that request ( we ' re looking at this with the attorneys and may choose at a future date to change the way this has been administered in the past , as this situation currently causes the partnership to incur an economic loss ) . after being notified of the need for a schedule adjustment , brazos is free to reset its hourly electric nominations to allow for gas deliveries to the extent it desires ( provided they ' re still capped at 45 , 000 dth / d if they take gas ) . whenever they go this route , however , we need to hold them to the electric nomination ( i . e . , they should get a courtesy call from an operator each and every time they go over the nominated electricity amount ) . remind brazos that under the ppa , they will be billed for penalties associated with not adhering to their electric nominations on days on which they ' ve elected to take gas . if the issue of precedent comes up , remind them that we ' re operating in a new territory and that electric - gas nominations have only been made over the past 7 months ; it wasn ' t until recently that we ' ve been able to attribute imbalance penalties to brazos , which has caused us to look at the scheduling provisions of the agreement much more closely . as a show of good faith , we should also make an attempt to track gas consumed / nominated for redelivery and advise them toward the end of the month of opportunities to up their gas nominations . hope this helps to clarify where we are . rh - - - - - original message - - - - - from : " ken riesz " @ enron [ mailto : imceanotes - + 22 ken + 20 riesz + 22 + 20 + 3 cken + 2 eriesz + 40 naes + 2 ecom + 3 e + 40 enron @ enron . com ] sent : friday , june 15 , 2001 4 : 27 pm to : mazowita , mike ; hill , garrick ; ward , charles subject : gas nom ' s chuck , i just wanted to make sure everyone has the same undertstanding of the gas nominations and usage issue . today with this most recent daily nomination revision from brazos , brazos ( waco ) now understands that we are going to hold them to 45 , 000 mbtu ' s when they are requesting electrical generation and gas energy . however , i want everone of us to understand that a nomination from brazos for a 6312 mwh , s ( 263 / hr ) , will require the plant to utilize 47 , 500 to 48 , 500 mbtu ' s at this ambient temperature to deliver the requested energy . to allow brazos any gas the total delivered electrical energy would have to be something less than 258 mw loading per hour . regards , ken

Subject: southern trails cancels calif part of pipeline conversion state regulations forces questar to cancel part of southern trails salt lake city - based questar corp . went out to bid earlier this month on four new compressors to complete its conversion work on the east - of - california portion of its 705 - mile southern trails pipeline from the san juan basin to the long beach port area of southern california . the portion of the converted oil pipeline between the california border and the four corners area in new mexico will open june 1 next year , a questar spokesman said monday . it is unlikely the almost 300 - mile portion of the former oil pipeline in california will be brought into natural gas service due to state regulatory provisions that make it uneconomic for prospect customers to leave their local supplier for part of their gas supplies . questar currently is looking for optional uses and a potential buyer for that portion of the project . whether any of the pipeline ' s proposed 110 mmcf / d of supplies gets into california would depend on the takeaway capacity at the border and / or what a new operator on the california side might do with the pipeline , questar ' s spokesperson said .

Subject: draft organizational announcement about japan may i please have your comments if any on this draft by close of business wednesday . we hope to have agreed on the q & a ' s by then and to send it out the announcement on thursday . john to be sent to : all enron europe , all employees in japan , all global markets and all vps and up around the company enron has established several wholesale businesses in japan in the last year including metals , power plant development ( via our investment in encom ) , coal , lng & weather . though japan continues to make progress towards a liberalized electricity market , significant barriers to power trading remain under the current interim market structure . until further tangible steps are taken to improve third party access for electricity in japan , we will suspend our power marketing efforts and focus on the significant opportunities that currently exist in our other wholesale businesses . once the necessary regulatory changes have been completed we expect to aggressively pursue enron ' s traditional position as the leading buyer and seller of electricity in every deregulated market . based on these changes joe hirl our president of enron japan will move to the global markets group and lead a team that will focus on developing all our global markets opportunities in japan especially weather , oil , lng , coal , and shipping . we expect to continue our general recruiting of japanese nationals and as president of enron japan , joe will continue to provide the overall business leadership to both recruiting and the analyst and associate program in japan . the finance origination team headed by jeremy thirsk will continue to report to joe and also move to global markets . our power trading group led by morton erik pettersen will transition into other roles around enron . the equity / fx / interest rate team which is a part of global markets has two employees in the tokyo office today and they expect to expand their efforts throughout the year . the encom group , which is our power plant development business ( with minority partners ) and headed by carey sloan will continue its efforts in developing power plants in japan . we are pleased with the progress we are making on a number of sites and encom will continue to report to the enron europe office of the chairman . our metals team headed by kazunari sugimoto will continue to report through enron metals in london . by may we expect enron credit to have two to three employees in tokyo pursing the credit derivative business . these employees remain in enron credit , a part of enron europe . ebs has two employees headed by jim weisser and this team expects to expand by year end . the industrial markets team also expects to have two employees in the tokyo office in the next couple of months . in the last seven months the commercial support services for japan have been transitioned to london for support and this is not changing . jane mcbride heads the legal team and will continue to functionally report to mark evans , general counsel in london . the rac function will continue to report to ted murphy , head of rac for enron europe . the risk management and accounting team is headed by jan - erland bekeng will continue to functionally report to fernley dyson in london . the it , hr , tax and real estate teams will also continue to functionally report to london . nick o ' day who heads both the public affairs group ( government & regulatory affairs and the public relations ) in japan will report to the enron europe office of the chair with a public relations functional reporting to jackie genle in london and a government affairs functional reporting to rick shappiro in houston . we anticipate that his team ' s efforts will be primarily directed to supporting the encom power plant development team but he will also continue to provide support for global markets , ebs & industrial markets . we have already made considerable progress in breaking into the japanese markets across a wide range of enron businesses and we anticipate that this will be a major profit center for profit growth for years to come . through these current changes we can demonstrate our ability to be flexible and target our resources where they will realise the most immediate value for the company .

Subject: re : accounting for transaction done with bridgeline sorry i am so late in replying ! it would seem that the mtm issue is bridgeline ' s decision and would solely be based on whether or not they are , in fact , trading as defined in eitf 98 - 10 . there are about 4 pages of criteria set forth in that document . that may be a question you want to ask trevor mihalik , but i do know that initially they did not meet 98 - 10 criteria . their business may well have changed by now . i am confused by your suggestion about whether or not to involve commercial . i may not understand , but we do already have a means to track our 40 % . we can certainly mark 60 % of any business we do with bridgeline , but the other 40 % should be treated as affiliate business . wes brent a price 05 / 23 / 2000 06 : 07 am to : wes colwell / hou / ect @ ect cc : steve jackson / hou / ect @ ect subject : accounting for transaction done with bridgeline wes - are we still anticipating that bridgeline will be allowed mark - to - market status at some point in the future ? if so , what criteria must bridgeline meet and what is the expected timeline on it ? if this is going to happen soon , i would suggest that we avoid getting commercial involved and developing a process to track our 40 % portion of bridgeline . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - forwarded by brent a price / hou / ect on 05 / 23 / 2000 05 : 57 am - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - from : steve jackson 05 / 19 / 2000 12 : 29 pm to : brent a price / hou / ect @ ect cc : subject : accounting for transaction done with bridgeline fyi - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - forwarded by steve jackson / hou / ect on 05 / 19 / 2000 12 : 28 pm - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - from : georgeanne hodges 05 / 01 / 2000 04 : 11 pm to : steve jackson / hou / ect @ ect cc : wes colwell / hou / ect @ ect , mary lynne ruffer / hou / ect @ ect subject : accounting for transaction done with bridgeline steve , aa has indicated that our proposal with regard to transactions done between ena and bridgeline sounds ok . they did bring up a good point about how the 40 % would be shown for purposes of position and loss limits , which under our scenario of just using schedule ' c ' to defer the 40 % we would effectively be showing the 100 % for all other measures . i told them that we would monitor for materiality before putting a manual process in place . i think we should now meet with the commercial folks to explain the real p \ l impact . would you take the lead on deciding who that should be and get a meeting set up ? thanks

Subject: california 3 / 23 executive summary : bottom line - qfs better off today , utilities in worse shape after passing senate , the qf bill fails on technical grounds in assembly cal energy ruling provides possible escape for qfs from utility commitments california net short gas supply for the summer worsens if qfs break contracts hedge funds acquiring utility commercial paper , further litigation expected 1 . qf bill fails in surprise twist ab 8 x ( the qf bill ) failed in the assembly ( 48 - 24 ) . the republicans were opposed because three measures , the sdg & e fix , the ab lx fix , and the qf fix were all rolled into one bill by the senate . they want the three measures split up . concern was raised by san diego members regarding those provisions and they wanted to see it separately in the bill form that it is currently in sb 43 x . as noted yesterday , the qfs will now await a cpuc ruling on tuesday . 2 . cal energy ruling sets stage for " dozens " of similar q . f . suits the cpuc ruling is now less important because of the cal energy ruling yesterday , which gave the qfs another tactic to escape their commitments to the near bankrupt utilities . cal energy reportedly would have filed an involuntary bankruptcy tomorrow ( friday ) had they not won their law suit . dozens , if not hundreds of suits identical to that filed by calenergy can now be expected from the other qfs . the qfs reportedly see themselves as free from the utilities now and want to sell direct into the merchant market , possibly out - of - state . they also want to avoid any deal whereby the state would force them to supply power in a stage 2 or stage 3 alert , and will contest any such measure with the ferc . 3 . summer outlook worsens the outlook for the summer now appears much grimmer for the state . if the gas - fired qfs alone manage to extricate themselves from their contracts with the utilities , the state will be a net 10 , 000 mw short for the summer rather than 5 , 000 mw . this is a much larger net short position to fill , and will be much harder for state treasurer angelides to sell to wall street . if all of the qfs break their contracts , the state will be 14 , 000 to 15 , 000 mw short . essentially , if the qfs are successful in court ( as it appears they would be ) , they are no longer part of the pool of low , fixed - rate power that the state can count on . the onus now appears to be on treasurer angelides to come up with a rate schedule . the qfs may go to him and ask for the state to act as forward cover for their gas contracts ( the state would , of course , charge for this privilege ) and negotiate a more flexible rate structure . 4 pressure mounts on utilities none of this helps the utilities ' situation . in fact , now that the qfs have a way out of their contracts through the courts , it appears that the business base of the utilities is reduced , so they are actually in a worse situation . reportedly some of the utilities ' commercial paper now has been sold to hedge funds . as one source put it , " the vultures have moved in . " these are " the types of people who litigate . "

Subject: new cash conrol process - 2 : 00 pm meeting , december 5 , 2001 in the 50 th floor board room overview our bankruptcy filing requires a cultural change in the cash management procedures of enron . because of our fiduciary obligation to our creditors , we now must move to centralized cash management . these new procedures will amend our prior policy . as management of the " debtor " , we should approach each decision about our business , including cash receipts and disbursements , from the perspective of , " does this enhance the value of the debtor ' s estate ? " this memo addresses the new policies that are to be immediately implemented both for entities in the chapter 11 reorganization and entities that have not filed . there will be a meeting wednesday , december 5 , 2001 at 2 : 00 pm in the board room on the 50 th floor to discuss the new policies . as a debtor - in - possession ( " dip " ) , we have new cash flow reporting obligations and we must develop and adhere to a cash flow budget . failure to adhere could have serious consequences to our dip financing availability as well as diminish our credibility with the creditors with whom we must negotiate our ultimate exit from chapter 11 as a reorganized entity . all enron business units ( not just the ones in bankruptcy ) will need to conform to these new requirements because additional entities are likely to be included in the bankruptcy filing , and because it is extremely important for enron management to be able to see the totality of cash flow requirements for the company . there are special procedures outlined at the end of the memo specifically relating to the business units in bankruptcy ( the debtor business units ) . new processes and procedures until further notice , a newly formed committee , the cash flow management committee ( the " committee " ) , will meet daily to review and approve daily payments and 5 - day projections for each business unit . the committee will be headed by george wasaff and will also consist of ray bowen , dave gorte , tim despain , bob butts , julia murray and lisa mellencamp . the committee will be assisted by our financial advisor , batchelder & partners and our outside counsel , weil , gotshal ( 2 ) be mission critical ; and ( 3 ) there must not be a substitute vendor . the business unit heads will be responsible for ensuring that recommendations to the committee for any disbursements to critical pre - petition vendors meet this test . the committee ' s presumption will be that a vendor is not critical . if you believe that a pre - petition claim clearly meets the " critical " test , you may submit it as a clearly flagged item , stating your reasons for requested payment . the committee and corporate management will consider these recommendations by the business unit . internal controls we need to reassess internal controls and determine if changes are required , especially in light of recent personnel changes . all internal controls , new and existing , will be subject to review by andrew parsons . he will be communicating with you regarding his assessment and requirements for any changes to be made . i look forward to seeing you this afternoon at the meeting . exhibit a - enron entities that have filed filed december 2 , 2001 1 . enron metals and commodity 2 . enron corp .

Subject: 2002 ea budget with enw budget update / suggestions : piper , richter , and webb met with whalley this saturday for a few hours on overall enrononline strategy and budget . we showed him the development completed to date and the general development list going forward . we also showed him the down time report as well as some growth numbers over the last 12 months . we also explained a few of the commercial objectives going forward . finally , we showed him the same suggested eol budget plan we showed you , including 2001 plan vs . 2001 forecast vs . 2002 plan as well as the allocation methodology . greg is generally ok with the total 2002 plan number for eol ( $ 37 . 7 million fully loaded with bonus , indirects and depreciation ) , why we want that money and where it would be spent . what he did not like was the allocation methodology , which is currently cost based and based on development and products . he suggested a charge that included a fixed fee plus a product setup fee plus a product maintenance fee plus a per transaction charge , etc . richter and webb are researching that and will try to see if it will work . i think you and i can agree the $ 37 . 7 million is good for 2002 but we still need to agree on your part for ea . the current cost based suggestion for ea for eol for 2002 is about $ 22 million . a question is , will you and lavo accept any charges for 2002 for eol based on transactions ? sheriff also has the entire eol suggested budget and his part . we meet eim and egm today on their total enw charges . on operations , the current suggested 2002 ea charge is $ 44 . 7 million , which is also a fully loaded number and is slightly down from 2001 forecast ( sally and bob and i can explain that in detail this week ) . what i would like to do is agree between you and i that you will accept that as eas budget number for 2002 plan for operations . what we still need to work on is how we would possibly bill that in some fixed and variable form that includes transaction counts . on infrastructure , the current suggested ea plan number for 2002 $ 40 . 9 million . this is down from 2001 forecast . this does not include the $ 10 . 5 million of controllable expense you budget directly for ea . the issue left here is what is eas headcount , what is the headcount in it development and what is the server infrastructure charge related to it development that would effect the ea number . on the first issue , we have the ea headcount as represented by hr . the current ea infrastructure charge assumes that complete number . it is larger than the number you have . you have requested we deal with some of that additional headcount differently since ea can ' t bill out those on a fully loaded basis . we will work with wes and his team on that today and tomorrow to come up with a plan . on it development , the current suggested 2002 plan expense number for ea , fully loaded , is $ $ 44 . 5 million vs . a 2001 forecast of $ 34 . 4 million . also , the 2002 suggested capital number for ea is $ 50 . 1 million vs . a 2001 forecast capital number of $ 50 million . the question is , what did you get for your $ 84 . 4 million in 2001 and what would you get for $ 94 . 6 million in 2002 ? first , mark and sally and i met on sunday and we want the 2002 plan numbers to be down from 2001 forecast . what we need to do in the next three days is finalize what are the critical maintenance and new development projects for 2002 for ea . our team is bob hall , mark pickering ( mark will call on stock and perlman and rao and hotte as he sees necessary ) and greg piper with pickering having the final say for enw . can you tell me who you want from your side ( story ? belden ? ) to work with us three over the next few days until we agree ? we want to work on it around the clock until it is at least approximately right . your thoughts ? gp greg piper president & ceo enron net works llc _ _ _ _ _

" this is far from over , " said one person familiar with the negotiations . several important points , including the exchange ratio , were still being worked out . dynegy expects to argue that enron shareholders will benefit from the upside of combining the two companies and that a transaction will add to dynegy ' s earnings because of potential synergies . spokesmen from enron and dynegy declined to comment . if approved by regulators , the deal would be a stunning development for enron , which transformed itself from a staid natural - gas - pipeline company into a highflying power - trading giant only to see its share price - - and hefty market valuation - - plummet in a matter of weeks . and for enron to sell itself for a low price is sure to stun investors . under the terms being worked out last night , enron chairman kenneth lay would have a seat on the combined company ' s board , but wouldn ' t hold any formal management position , said the people familiar with the matter . mr . lay may take on a consulting role . meanwhile , chuck watson , chairman and chief executive of dynegy , would be ceo of the combined company , while his no . 2 , stephen bergstrom , will president . enron has been scrambling for days to line up quick financing from a prominent outside investor and has been in discussions with private - equity firms and power - trading companies . the company desperately needs to win back its credibility on wall street following the disclosure that the securities and exchange commission was investigating the partnerships created to serve as a hedge against fluctuating market conditions . discussions between dynegy and enron began about 10 days ago , but intensified last weekend . enron also is expected today to disclose more financial dealings about the partnerships . a person close to dynegy said the potential acquirer feels it understands enron ' s business and is apprised of the liabilities , which have been factored into the transaction . should enron strike a deal , it hopes to stabilize its stock price . enron fell 6 . 4 % , or 62 cents , to $ 9 . 05 at 4 p . m . composite trading on the new york stock exchange . at one point yesterday morning , enron ' s stock had fallen 25 % on news reports that enron ' s efforts to line up investors had failed . the stock recovered after cnbc and dow jones newswires reported the talks with dynegy . the shares are at a new 52 - week low and far from the 52 - week high of $ 84 . 88 . dynegy fell $ 3 , or 8 . 3 % , to $ 33 , at 4 p . m . in big board trading . however , some investors believed the company ' s share price could benefit from the deal . jason selch , an energy analyst at wanger asset management in chicago , a large dynegy shareholder , said the company has a history of pulling off complicated deals and added that because enron is in such bad shape , dynegy could dictate the terms of the deal , shielding itself from potential losses due to shareholder lawsuits or problems with enron ' s complicated off - balance sheet dealings . " if they make an offer , they will be making an offer in order to get a steal , " said mr . selch , who says enron ' s core energy - trading business is being valued at about half the normal market valuation of these operations . " i think they will be acquiring a business that will launch them into the no . 1 market - share position in energy trading , " mr . selch added . whether a deal with dynegy materializes , the fact that enron is willing to consider a sale shows how its fortunes have sagged and underscores how desperate it is for a savior . the company , which was at the pinnacle of its success just a year earlier , boasted a market capitalization of $ 71 billion about a year ago and is now valued at about $ 7 billion . in exchange for the immediate capital infusion , dynegy is expected to get convertible preferred stock . in that type of deal , an investor receives a safe , bondlike interest payment and then can convert that holding into common stock after the share price rises to a specified level . enron also had been soliciting interest from private equity firms , but any discussions with those parties were proceeding on a slower track . people familiar with the negotiations said it was possible the financial players could still play some sort of role in any enron transaction , although details weren ' t immediately available . buyout firms clayton , dubilier & rice and blackstone group , which had been approached by enron to make an investment , decided against doing so , according to people familiar with the matter . indeed , enron ' s move to publicly disclose new information about the partnerships could provide intriguing details to any other potential bidders who are interested in a deal , but were reluctant to pursue enron without knowing more about those transactions . and because dynegy may only be paying a small premium , another suitor may be able to step up to the plate . the deal , if agreed to , will add to dynegy ' s earnings in the first year . the new entity will focus on the core business of north american and european wholesale , commercial and industrial energy markets and will capitalize on the opportunities generated by the combined , diversified asset - backed network supported by the strongest intellectual capital in the industry . aside from restoring confidence among its investors , enron has faced growing pressure from its trading partners . the company is offering special protections to some trading partners , hoping to prevent a mass exodus due to fears it could face further credit downgrades or wind up seeking the protection of a federal bankruptcy court . the protection takes the form of a " netting agreement " that permits a trading partner to offset the sums it is owed by various enron entities against the amounts that it owes the enron concerns . without such an arrangement , a company might owe money to one enron entity but have to stand in a long , slow line to collect sums owed by a different enron concern should the company seek bankruptcy - court protection . with netting , positions could cancel each other out , at least to some extent , and reduce a firm ' s ultimate credit exposure . enron spokesman mark palmer said the company has plenty of cash and has no need or intention of seeking protection from creditors , with whom it is current . - - - jathon sapsford , robert frank and ken brown contributed to this article . copyright ? 2000 dow jones section c dynegy is said to be near to acquiring enron for $ 8 billion by richard a . oppel jr . and andrew ross sorkin 11 / 08 / 2001 the new york times page 1 , column 2 c . 2001 new york times company the board of dynegy inc . tentatively approved a deal last night to acquire the enron corporation , the once - mighty energy - trading company laid low by a financial crisis and government investigation , executives close to the transaction said . a deal would enable dynegy to buy the much bigger enron at a fire - sale price - - about $ 8 billion in stock , or roughly $ 10 a share , for a company that less than a year ago had a market value of nearly $ 70 billion . but with stock and bond investors fleeing , some of its trading partners refusing to do business with it , enron had few choices but to talk to dynegy . as part of the deal , chevron texaco , which owns a 27 percent stake in dynegy , would give enron a cash infusion of at least $ 1 . 5 billion up front and an additional $ 1 billion when the deal closed . the executives said the companies hope to finalize the details and announce the deal today . if completed , a takeover by dynegy , a company only about one - quarter its size in revenue , would represent a remarkable humbling of enron , the nation ' s biggest buyer and seller of natural gas and electricity . enron had $ 139 . 7 billion in revenue for the first nine months of the year . as recently as last spring enron was lionized by investors as an innovator that had in many ways created and cleverly dominated the nation ' s deregulated energy markets . it would also vindicate not only dynegy , which took a more measured approach to doing business in those markets , but also critics uncomfortable with energy deregulation who said enron ' s energy trading was ruthless , its finances murky and its power and influence too extensive . the company ' s chairman and chief executive , kenneth l . lay , is a close friend of president bush . he has been one of mr . bush ' s largest campaign contributors , and no other energy company gave more money to republican causes last year than enron . mr . lay would be on the board of the combined companies , the executives said , but it was unclear if he would have an operational role . enron ' s problems came to light last month when the company disclosed $ 1 billion in write - downs and an unusual $ 1 . 2 billion reduction in shareholder equity . the reduction in equity arose from transactions with investment partnerships involving andrew fastow , the chief financial officer , who was forced to resign on oct . 24 . the securities and exchange commission is investigating those transactions . enron is expected today to send the s . e . c . answers to questions the agency has posed in its investigation . the answers have been reviewed by dynegy officials , the executives said , and are expected to be released publicly . enron is scheduled to meet its creditors tomorrow about the company ' s continuing crisis - - and about the merger deal , if there is one . people close to the deal say the company hopes that a deal with dynegy , and the release of the answers to the s . e . c . , will calm the crisis that has engulfed the company and led other energy companies that trade with enron to curtail their credit exposure to the company . besides worries about the huge losses and the s . e . c . investigation , investors and creditors are nervously watching enron ' s credit rating . moody ' s investors service and standard and poor ' s have already cut the rating to two notches above junk status , and on monday , fitch inc . cut it to one notch above junk . as part of the acquisition , dynegy would be taking on enron ' s $ 12 . 8 billion debt load - - a number that does not include billions of dollars of other debt , accumulated off the balance sheet , that has played a major role in enron ' s current problems . the executives said they expected the deal would lead to the sale of some enron assets to pay down the $ 12 . 8 billion debt . should enron lose its investment grade rating , other energy trading companies could curtail their business with the company even further , and enron could be forced to issue tens of millions of shares of stock to cover off - balance sheet debts that it has guaranteed . early wednesday , shares of enron plunged 28 percent , to about $ 7 , on fears that the company was unable to line up new investors . but the stock took back most of its losses in the afternoon after cnbc reported the talks with dynegy . shares of enron closed at $ 9 . 05 , off 62 cents . dynegy shares closed at $ 33 , down $ 3 . in addition to both companies ' very large presence in energy trading , enron owns the portland general electric company , a utility in oregon it had already agreed to sell , and dynegy owns the illinova corporation , a retail electricity and natural gas utility in illinois . regulators may take a hard look at those utilities in reviewing a merger deal , said jeff dietert , an analyst with simmons & company in houston . ' ' then you ' ve got concerns about market power , ' ' he said . ' ' it ' s just a lot of different issues to deal with before we get too excited that this deal is going to get done . ' ' the acquisition would combine enron , which dominates united states trading of electricity and natural gas and has been shedding its hard assets , with dynegy , a company that has pursued a much different strategy of using trading to maximize earnings from its power plants . enron has always concentrated on sophisticated financial trading strategies , a senior executive at a rival energy - trading firm , said . ' ' dynegy has always been more of a logistical player of physical assets , ' ' he said . ' ' those are very different cultures and very different mentalities . ' ' the executive noted that there had been an immense talent drain from enron in the last two weeks . ' ' it has become a frenzy , ' ' he said . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . trading places : fancy finances were key to enron ' s success , and now to its distress - - - impenetrable deals have put firm in position where it may lose independence - - - talks with rival dynegy by rebecca smith and john r . emshwiller staff reporters of the wall street journal 11 / 08 / 2001 the wall street journal al ( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones & company , inc . ) when enron corp . convened its annual conference with credit analysts and bond investors in houston last february , the energy - trading giant was soaring and looking to climb higher . the company ' s stock was trading at about $ 80 a share , giving it a stock market value of $ 70 billion . though up fourfold from three years earlier , the stock price wasn ' t nearly high enough , enron ' s new chief executive , jeffrey skilling , told the audience . with its dominant position in energy - trading markets and its highly touted new moves into telecommunications , enron stock should be at $ 126 a share , mr . skilling argued . all in all , a vintage performance for a company not known for being bashful . " a lot of hype . a lot of spin , " recalls todd shipman , a standard & poor ' s analyst who attended the conference . " that was enron . " yesterday , enron stock closed at $ 9 . 05 in new york stock exchange trading . mr . skilling is no longer around to promote the stock . in august , he unexpectedly resigned as chief executive after only six months in the top job . chief financial officer andrew fastow was replaced last month as controversy escalated over his role in running private partnerships involved in billions of dollars of transactions with enron . kenneth lay , enron ' s chief executive , has had to give up retirement plans to return to the helm . lately , the company has been offering special credit protection to increasingly nervous trading partners , including reliant energy inc . and entergy corp . the goal : to provide assurance that enron is a creditworthy partner and to prevent an exodus of customers . enron ' s trading operation generates 90 % of the company ' s profits . it looked yesterday as if the endgame might be beginning . mr . lay and enron ' s board were discussing a possible acquisition of enron by its much - smaller hometown energy - trading rival , dynegy inc . , in a stock swap valued at $ 7 billion to $ 8 billion . ( see related article on page a 3 . ) any merger of the two companies would probably face lengthy regulatory scrutiny , so dynegy is also considering injecting $ 1 . 5 billion into enron immediately to help stabilize the company ' s finances , according to people familiar with the situation . the deal would also include a significant role for oil powerhouse chevrontexaco , which owns a 26 % stake in dynegy and would be likely to provide much of the cash for any enron transaction . dynegy ' s emergence as a serious bidder for enron could indicate to other interested parties that enron ' s problems can be solved . in fact , the collapse in enron ' s stock price would make it fairly easy for another large energy player to top any dynegy offer . royal dutch / shell group is one such prominent company . a takeover by dynegy or any other company would almost certainly presage the departure of the 59 - year - old mr . lay . he oversaw the transformation of enron from a nondescript natural - gas pipeline company with annual revenue of under $ 5 billion in the late 1980 s to a global energy colossus with revenue that is expected to approach $ 200 billion this year . it has turned out that the formula behind that transformation contained the seeds for the company ' s current troubles . executives created an ever - more - labyrinthine financial structure to support enron ' s explosive growth rate . billions of dollars of debt - - which could have weakened enron ' s credit rating and slowed growth - - was kept off the balance sheet through tangled webs of transactions with dozens of related entities . as the financial demands became greater and the transactions more complex , enron officials began creating and heading some of the entities , raising serious conflict - of - interest questions . neither enron nor dynegy would comment . royal dutch / shell also declined to comment . messrs . lay , skilling and fastow either declined to comment or didn ' t return phone calls seeking interviews . enron officials have maintained that the markets are overreacting to a spate of bad , but nonfatal , news . on oct . 16 , the company announced a $ 618 million third - quarter loss and disclosed a $ 1 . 2 billion reduction of shareholder equity due in part to dealings with the fastow - related partnerships . the company has said that its ongoing businesses are strong and it has the financial wherewithal to weather the crisis . all of its actions have been legal and properly disclosed , enron has stressed . still , its predicament is daunting . the securities and exchange commission has started a formal investigation into possible violations of federal securities law involving the fastow - related partnerships . several shareholder lawsuits seeking class - action status have been filed against top company officials , alleging fraud and seeking to recover some of the $ 20 billion in market value that enron shares have lost in the past month . to address growing jitters in the energy and financial markets , enron has drawn down billions of dollars of credit lines , negotiated new ones and sought a new equity infusion . as turmoil has engulfed the company , mr . lay and other top enron executives have kept largely out of public view - - in sharp contrast to the company ' s normally outspoken public persona . the one recent public - relations initiative , a conference call for analysts and big investors , turned into what even enron officials concede privately was a debacle . it left company executives looking evasive and defensive rather than open and confident . how did enron , which routinely made published lists of the most - admired and innovative companies in america , fly so high and fall so fast ? the answer lies in a combination of brilliance and overconfidence on a scale rarely seen in the business world . in the process , the company helped redefine much of the energy marketplace on matters as fundamental as how power is bought and sold and how a company produces a profit from doing so . for example , the company helped create an electricity - trading market in which participants rarely take physical delivery of the commodity but instead merely tally profits or losses from transactions . in the accounting realm , it pioneered techniques that allowed energy companies to record profits or losses on long - term contracts that hadn ' t yet produced any revenue . " we caught a little flak in the early 1990 s from people who , i guess , thought we were pulling a fast one , " enron ' s chief accounting officer , richard causey , said in an interview in august . he added that this accounting method was the most accurate way to measure energy - trading results . enron ' s audacity and success sent other energy companies scrambling to emulate it , a process that abn amro analyst paul patterson calls " enron envy . " the company tested the limits of securities and accounting rules . for example , enron ' s sec filings have included statements about the fastow - related transactions that might meet the letter of disclosure laws but are so complex that even some wall street analysts and accounting professors have found them indecipherable . enron ' s seemingly impenetrable financial structure , hardly noticed by wall street in the company ' s heyday , is now a matter of serious concern in a suddenly skeptical investment community . " it ' s not easy to regain something as basic as trust , " says goldman sachs analyst david fleischer , a longtime enron fan . in the recent conference call with enron executives , mr . fleischer pleaded with the company to be more forthcoming about its operations - - something it has been promising to do for months . while enron employs some 20 , 000 people , its rise and fall can , in large measure , be traced to three men : messrs . lay , skilling and fastow . mr . lay joined the company in 1984 when it was still called houston natural gas , a regional pipeline operator . back then , the natural - gas industry was a largely regional business and about as exciting as watching a pipeline operate . but mr . lay had big plans for his company , always preaching that natural gas was the fuel of the future . his prediction has been largely borne out when it comes to such functions as fueling electric - power plants . he wanted to take the company beyond natural gas . enron bought an electric utility in portland , ore . , and built power plants around the world . it developed its potent energy - trading operation , which buys and sells contracts to provide electricity in the same way that contracts for wheat and pork bellies are traded . these deals were done with utilities , industrial power users and other trading firms . to help enlarge this empire , he recruited aggressive young executives . none was brighter or more assertive than mr . skilling , a harvard business school graduate and former mckinsey & co . consultant who joined enron in 1990 . under messrs . lay and skilling , the company pushed zealously for the deregulation of energy markets - - particularly that bastion of monopoly businesses , the electric - utility industry . enron officials argued that open , competitive markets could help consumers and , not coincidentally , provide huge profit opportunities in energy trading . mr . skilling called the energy - trading business " a once - in - a - lifetime opportunity to establish a position to last for the next 100 years . " by the late 1990 s , enron had evolved into primarily a trading company , rather than an owner of power plants and pipelines . in pursuit of their deregulation goals , enron officials became major players in american politics . mr . lay has given nearly $ 2 million to president bush during his political career and is a personal friend of the president , vice president cheney and several members of the cabinet . one of mr . skilling ' s early hires after joining enron was mr . fastow , at the time a 29 - year - old mba from northwestern ' s kellogg school who had been working on leveraged buyouts and other complicated deals at continental bank in chicago . former enron officials and others say that mr . skilling quickly became mr . fastow ' s mentor in the same way that mr . lay had become mr . skilling ' s . as mr . skilling oversaw the building of enron ' s vast trading operation , mr . fastow saw to the financing of it . " andy was the guy you saw when you wanted money " for a project , says one former enron senior manager . mr . skilling was named enron ' s chief operating officer in 1997 . mr . fastow got the top finance job a year later , at the age of 36 . under mr . fastow , enron ' s finance department tripled in size , to more than 100 people . enron needed the added financial brainpower . as it expanded , debt and liquidity were constant concerns . what ' s more , the company ' s ambitions were roving beyond therms and kilowatts as it began to make markets in everything from water to weather . enron ' s most highly touted non - energy initiative , and mr . skilling ' s pet project , came in the area of telecommunications . the company built a coast - to - coast fiber - optic network and envisioned trading " bandwidth , " or network capacity , the way it traded electricity or natural gas . enron has invested several hundred million dollars so far in the project , which has produced losses of over $ 400 million . yet at the february analyst meeting in houston , mr . skilling unabashedly valued enron ' s fiber - optic business at $ 36 billion , according to people who were at the meeting . but to make all of its growth dreams possible , enron had to make sure that its balance sheet didn ' t become too laden with debt . too much debt would lead major ratings agencies , such as moody ' s investors service and standard & poor ' s , to lower enron ' s credit rating . such downgrades could significantly increase the company ' s cost of borrowing and make it more difficult to finance its continued expansion . in typically aggressive fashion , enron lobbied the ratings agencies with the same vigor that it lobbied legislators . at the february meeting , mr . fastow urged analysts to raise enron ' s credit rating on long - term debt from triple - b - plus to single - a - minus . but the analysts shrugged off mr . fastow ' s entreaties . they didn ' t see the cash flow , earnings , or debt coverage required for such an upgrade , says one attendee . undeterred , mr . fastow said the higher rating would strengthen the company ' s basic finances , which could then justify the higher rating . this circular argument provoked derision among analysts , and enron didn ' t get its ` a ' rating . instead , the company was recently downgraded by the major ratings agencies as a result of its financial turmoil . in moves that kept down its reported debt burden , enron turned increasingly to off - balance - sheet transactions through limited partnerships with outside parties . in such an arrangement , enron could contribute money , stock or other assets to the partnership . the partnership could then borrow large sums to purchase assets or do business deals without the debt showing up on enron ' s books . while such partnership transactions had long been used in the natural - gas industry to finance deals , enron took the practice to new heights of complexity . leading that effort was mr . fastow and his team of young financial experts . in recent years , enron has done myriad deals with more than 30 partnerships . by far the most controversial to come to light , so far , are the ones it has done with two partnerships - - known as ljm cayman lp and ljm 2 co - investment lp - - which were formed and operated by mr . fastow . the company has said that its transactions with these partnerships were designed to hedge against fluctuating market values of company assets and energy contracts . it isn ' t clear why enron would allow its chief financial officer to be in a fiduciary position at partnerships that stood to profit , possibly at the company ' s expense , from doing deals with it . to make matters worse , private ljm partnership documents indicate that mr . fastow personally made millions of dollars from the partnerships - - much more than he was being paid as enron ' s chief financial officer . enron officials have repeatedly said that mr . fastow ' s actions were reviewed and approved by top management and the board of directors . however , the company has refused to answer numerous specific questions about its dealings with the partnerships . enron has said that mr . fastow formally severed his ties with the partnerships in july in the face of rising discomfort about the arrangements on the part of analysts and major company investors . it is nearly impossible to stitch together anything comprehensible about the partnership deals from enron ' s sec filings . the only thing clear is that millions of shares of enron stock and billions of dollars of assets and notes were involved in the transactions . - - - robin sidel and jathon sapsford contributed to this article . copyright ?

" there ' s a difference between reducing exposure to enron and not doing business or demanding cash upfront , " he said , but he added that the company ' s trading partners have been " reexamining their attitude towards enron every moment of every day .

" copyright : the financial times limited nov . 8 , 2001 houston chronicle dynegy may acquire enron merger talks in advanced stage by laura goldberg copyright 2001 houston chronicle dynegy was in advanced talks wednesday night to acquire troubled rival enron corp . , according to people familiar with the matter . the sources said a merger could be announced as early as today between the two houston - based energy traders , which had been talking for about a week . if the smaller dynegy does buy enron - - known as a pioneer in the world of energy trading - - it would mark a surprising end for a company that until early this year was among wall street ' s darlings . since then , a series of problems has tarnished the image of enron , which based on revenues is houston ' s largest company . enron ' s woes quickly multiplied after it made troubling financial disclosures in its third - quarter earnings report last month . after the report , enron ' s stock price plummeted , the securities and exchange commission launched an investigation into certain enron dealings and the company ' s credit rating has been downgraded , leaving it in a weakened state . that ' s where dynegy comes in . dynegy proposed a stock swap with a modest premium over enron ' s stock price , the sources said , adding that enron had been pressing for a higher premium than dynegy offered . shares in enron closed down 62 cents wednesday , at $ 9 . 05 . based on enron ' s market capitalization , the stock deal is likely to be worth more than $ 7 billion . as part of the deal being discussed , chevrontexaco corp . , which owns about 27 percent of dynegy , would also immediately give $ 1 . 5 billion to enron , the people said . the money would be intended to help enron keep its investment - grade credit rating , which it needs to keep running its energy trading business . wall street has been questioning enron ' s ability to maintain that core business , which relies heavily on access to credit and cash . enron ' s board started meeting around 6 : 30 p . m . wednesday , while dynegy ' s board began meeting earlier during the day . spokesmen for dynegy , enron and chevrontexaco declined comment wednesday . enron is significantly larger than dynegy , which last year reported $ 29 . 4 billion in revenues and as of earlier this year had almost 1 , 600 employees in houston . enron reported $ 100 . 8 billion in revenues last year and as of earlier this year had more than 7 , 000 houston employees . the two energy traders have complementary capabilities , said jeff dietert , an analyst with houston - based simmons institutional investors put up the lion ' s share of the money . the institutional investors , which can include pension funds , hedge funds , banks and other corporations , have their investments backed by the hard assets of the partnership . enron used simple off - balance - sheet deals in the past , but its strategy became more complex in the late 1990 s as it began fueling aggressive growth plans . in 1997 the company ' s growth from a pipeline company into a leading gas and energy trading business led it to a huge debt load that didn ' t match up with its credit ratings . maintaining that rating was crucial to the company ' s electricity and gas trading , which involved negotiated contracts with dozens of partners . the company could have put up its hard assets as backing to continue financing acquisitions and purchases , but enron ' s top brass were reluctant . instead , under fastow ' s guidance , enron ' s finance department became the equivalent of a bank , with a mission to raise capital . " we transformed finance into a merchant organization , one engaged in the intermediation of both commodity and capital risk positions , " fastow told cfo magazine in 1999 . " essentially , we would buy and sell risk positions . " the company also needed to raise more cash but couldn ' t issue equity , which would dilute shareholders ' value , or issue more debt , a threat to its credit rating . fastow ' s solution was to make it clear to the rating agencies that he was serious about keeping the good ratings by generating fast - growing cash flow , even though the company would issue more stock . a roadshow for analysts was organized to outline the plan and demonstrate the finance team ' s skills at maintaining the high - wire act . the sales pitch worked . when enron issued 17 . 2 million shares in an offering and raised about $ 800 million , rating agencies liked it and share values didn ' t drop . the second part of the plan involved selling off nonstrategic assets , such as pipelines and other business units , to create even more cash flow . that cash was reinvested . under this new , more aggressive strategy , enron grew in different ways . for example , in october 1998 the company acquired three new jersey power plants from cogen technologies by going to the capital markets to issue about $ 1 . 5 billion in equity and debt . enron kept that capital off its own balance sheets by creating a special - purpose entity to which it sold a 50 percent interest in the plants . another deal involved enron ' s $ 2 . 3 billion purchase of wessex water , a british water company , in 1998 . enron created a special off - balance - sheet partnership named atlantic water trust and issued $ 1 . 3 billion in enron shares into it . the trust then went to the capital markets to raise $ 1 billion in debt that was backed by those shares . the trust purchased wessex , and because enron owned no more than 50 percent of wessex , it didn ' t experience earnings dilution and didn ' t have that $ 1 billion in debt counted on its books . these complex deals won fastow and his team praise and industry awards . so what went wrong ? while many of enron ' s off - balance - sheet deals worked with little controversy , the accounting innovation eventually worked against the company . details on the more complicated deals , particularly the partnerships named ljm cayman and ljm 2 co - investment , which left the company with a $ 1 billion charge last quarter , have been hard to come by so far . but they appear to have been used to hedge against the risk of some of the company ' s newer lines of business beyond its core . " power plants in india , water companies , extension of their franchise to the mass retail market and using a fiber optic network to deliver content over the internet are all unrelated or only tangentially related to their core merchant energy business , " said ray niles , an analyst with salomon smith barney . " all of the write - offs appear to be in these noncore , nonenergy merchant areas . " the off - balance - sheet partnerships also went on to buy the stock of other companies , said john olson , an analyst with sanders morris harris . " they own pieces of a variety of companies they ' ve done asset trades with , oil - services companies , producers , " olson said . " and many of those shares are underwater right now . " the partnerships also appear to have invested in options to buy shares of enron at a fixed price with plans to make money by later selling them at a higher price . " it was perfectly sound logic when their stock was going up , but when it started to go down , it came as quite a shock , " olson said . while the details of enron ' s partnerships remain elusive for the time being , there ' s little doubt that unraveling their true nature will be difficult for even the keenest financial and legal minds .

" enron was initially proactive at teaming up with non - competitors but once it exhausted that route " it went in another direction . in the past few weeks , enron has cashed in about $ 3 billion in revolving credit it has with various banks to shore up investor confidence . last week , enron secured $ 1 billion in new financing , using some of its natural gas and pipeline assets as collateral . meanwhile , standard & poor ' s corp . on wednesday lowered its ratings on some of enron ' s credit linked notes and placed them on creditwatch . s & p said enron ' s plan to repair its damaged balance sheet through asset sales and other means will be insufficient . moody ' s investors service and fitch inc . have also downgraded the company ' s credit ratings . last week , enron announced it created a special committee headed by university of texas law school dean william powers to respond to the sec investigation . - - - on the net : http : / / www . dynegy . com http : / / www . enron . com copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . chevrontexaco affiliate dynegy in talks to buy enron for 7 - 8 bln usd - report 11 / 08 / 2001 afx news ( c ) 2001 by afp - extel news ltd new york ( afx ) - energy trading and power company dynegy inc , a chevrontexaco corp affiliate , is negotiating to buy enron corp for around 7 - 8 bln usd in stock , the wall street journal reported , quoting people familiar with the matter . because enron needs to shore up its finances now , dynegy also is expected to inject an additional 1 . 5 bln usd into enron immediately , the sources said . chevrontexaco , which holds 26 pct of dynegy , is expected to provide dynegy with the funds for the cash infusion and is playing a significant role in the negotiations . chevrontexaco will inject an additional 1 bln usd into the combined company once the deal is concluded so that its stake in dynegy is not substantially reduced and so the combined company has a healthy balance sheet , the journal said . the boards of dynegy , chevron and enron met yesterday to discuss a deal , but a seesawing enron stock price and the complexity of a transaction yet could derail the transaction , the newspaper added . under the terms being worked out last night , enron chairman kenneth lay would have a seat on the combined company ' s board , but would not hold a formal management position . jms for more information and to contact afx : www . afxnews . com and www . afxpress . com copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . usa : update 1 - fund alleges fat fees biased andersen on enron . by kevin drawbaugh 11 / 08 / 2001 reuters english news service ( c ) reuters limited 2001 . washington , nov 7 ( reuters ) - enron corp . paid one of the largest audit bills in corporate america last year to arthur andersen , regulatory filings showed on wednesday , as the big five accounting firm faced a lawsuit in oregon alleging its high - priced audit of the battered energy giant was flawed . houston - based enron , rocked by a federal investigation and trading at historic lows , paid arthur andersen $ 52 million last year in audit and non - audit fees , according to enron ' s 2001 proxy filed with the securities and exchange commission . that figure topped the fees paid by all similarly sized utility companies listed along with enron on the dow jones utility index , and all but a handful of the 30 , mostly much larger companies in the dow jones industrial average . the huge revenues taken in by arthur andersen from enron - comprising $ 25 million in audit fees and $ 27 million in other fees - amounted to about $ 1 million a week last year . that rich revenue flow influenced the accounting firm ' s judgment when it came to examining some unusual outside partnership arrangements involving enron now being probed by the sec , alleged a lawsuit filed last week in oregon . the sec declined to comment . " arthur andersen enjoyed a lucrative , long - standing business relationship with enron ' s senior management for which they received millions of dollars , " said the lawsuit filed by the southern electrical retirement fund , an electricians ' pension fund , against enron officers and arthur andersen . " maintaining the client relationship was highly dependent on the individual defendants , particularly enron ' s ceo ( kenneth ) lay , and arthur andersen compromised themselves to do so , " alleged southern electrical , which owns enron shares . a spokesman for arthur andersen said the chicago - based firm had not seen the oregon lawsuit and declined comment . he also declined to comment on the relative size of enron ' s fees . the troubles of enron beginning last month have led to numerous lawsuits against company officers , but the oregon action was the first known to target its auditor , as well . as the first anniversary of the issuance of sec auditor independence rules approaches next week , the enron - arthur andersen relationship was coming under increased scrutiny by regulators , plaintiffs ' attorneys and institutional investors . critics say andersen should have done more arthur andersen should have done more as auditor for enron to alert investors to the outside partnerships that are now being investigated by authorities , accounting experts said . " it certainly has to raise a lot of eyebrows , especially in the independence and objectivity issue , " said jay nisberg , an accounting consultant based in ridgefield , connecticut . arthur andersen should have pushed harder for more and clearer disclosure of the partnerships ' potential for conflicts of interest and financial risk to enron , critics said . enron last month ousted its chief financial officer andrew fastow . he was replaced by another enron executive . fastow was instrumental in setting up and managing the partnerships - ljm 2 co - investment lp and ljm cayman lp - that did complex financial transactions with enron , fastow ' s employer . the transactions were disclosed to enron investors in annual 10 k filings and proxy statements issued in 2000 and 2001 . but andersen should have done more to put the disclosures in plain english and highlight their potential for possible conflicts and risk to enron ' s finances , said critics . " the activities of these particular partnerships and the role of enron in them , it ' s not the kind of thing you stick in the proxy statement at the back somewhere in a series of innocuous paragraphs , " said mark cheffers , who heads accounting consultancy . com in massachusetts . enron - a former natural gas pipeline group that transformed itself into the nation ' s largest energy trader - said last month it was taking a $ 1 billion charge against earnings , as well as cutting shareholder equity by $ 1 . 2 billion largely due to soured transactions with fastow ' s partnerships . enron spokeswoman karen denne has said that arthur andersen knew about the ljm partnerships and " reviewed them to the extent they deemed necessary . " andersen ' s woes with waste management earlier on wednesday , waste management inc . said andersen would pay the firm $ 20 million to settle a professional malpractice suit related to an accounting scandal the garbage hauler was embroiled in more than two years ago . waste management itself agreed to pay $ 457 million to settle a class action lawsuit filed against it related to the scandal and problems that hammered its share price . the impact of the settlement , coupled with criticism of andersen ' s handling of enron , is likely to hurt andersen ' s brand and influence the type of advice and services it provides clients in the future , cheffers said . " it ' s obviously a jolt to their reputation , " he said . " but the bigger question is if they ' re going to reevaluate the advice they give their clients . " in june , arthur andersen was fined $ 7 million by the sec to settle charges it filed false and misleading audit reports of waste management in the largest ever civil penalty against a big five accounting firm , according to the sec . andersen did not admit or deny the charges .

( cvx ) , which owns a 26 % stake in dynegy , is expected to provide dynegy with the funds for the cash infusion and is playing a significant role in the negotiations . chevrontexaco then will inject another $ 1 billion into the combined company once the deal is concluded so that its stake in dynegy isn ' t substantially reduced . under the terms being worked out wednesday night , enron chairman kenneth lay would have a seat on the combined company ' s board , but wouldn ' t hold any formal management position , said the people familiar with the matter . mr . lay may take on a consulting role . the boards of dynegy , chevron and enron were meeting wednesday to discuss a potential deal , but a seesawing enron stock price and the complexity of a transaction yet could derail a deal , people familiar with the matter warned . several important points , including the exchange ratio , were still being worked out , but dynegy is expected to pay a very modest premium for enron ' s stock , arguing that enron shareholders will benefit from the upside of combining the two companies . enron also is expected thursday to disclose more financial dealings about the controversial partnerships . spokesmen from enron and dynegy declined to comment . if approved by regulators , the deal would be a stunning development for enron , which transformed itself from a staid natural - gas - pipeline company into a highflying power trading giant only to see its share price - - and hefty market valuation - - plummet in a matter of weeks . enron has been scrambling for days to line up quick financing from a prominent outside investor and has been in discussions with private - equity firms and power - trading companies . the company desperately needs to win back its credibility on wall street following the disclosure that the securities and exchange commission was investigating the partnerships created to serve as a hedge against fluctuating market conditions . discussions between dynegy and enron began about 10 days ago , but intensified last weekend . should enron strike a deal , it hopes to stabilize its stock price . enron fell 6 . 4 % , or 62 cents , to $ 9 . 05 at 4 p . m . composite trading on the new york stock exchange . at one point wednesday morning , enron ' s stock had fallen 25 % on news reports that enron ' s efforts to line up investors had failed . the stock recovered after cnbc and dow jones newswires reported the talks with dynegy . the shares are at a new 52 - week low and far from the 52 - week high of $ 84 . 88 . dynegy fell $ 3 , or 8 . 3 % , to $ 33 , at 4 p . m . in big board trading . however , some investors believed the company ' s share price could benefit from the deal . copyright ( c ) 2001 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . dynegy reportedly close to deal to buy enron for $ 8 billion 11 / 07 / 2001 associated press newswires copyright 2001 . the associated press . all rights reserved . houston ( ap ) - dynegy inc . was reportedly in the late stages of discussions wednesday night with rival enron corp . to buy the embattled energy - trading company for about $ 8 billion in stock , or roughly $ 10 per share . under the terms of the deal , enron would receive an immediate $ 1 . 5 billion cash infusion from oil giant chevron texaco , which holds a 27 percent stake in dynegy , the new york times reported on its web site , citing executives close to the discussion . chevron texaco would provide an additional $ 1 billion injection at a later date , the times reported , while dynegy would assume $ 12 . 8 billion in enron debt , plus billions of dollars in other debt that has been kept off the beleaguered company ' s balance sheet and has been a significant contributor to its current problems . enron chairman kenneth lay would not be given any formal management position in the combined company , although he would have a seat on its board , the wall street journal reported , citing people familiar with the matter . the boards of both companies were meeting late wednesday and could announce the deal as early as thursday , although the journal reported that the transaction could still be derailed . enron did not return calls seeking comment . dynegy spokesman steve stengel said the company would not respond to " rumor and speculation . " in wednesday trading , dynegy ' s shares were down $ 3 to close at $ 33 on the new york stock exchange , while enron ' s stock was off 62 cents and closed at $ 9 . 05 . shares of chevrontexaco rose 48 cents to $ 87 . 28 on the nyse . enron ' s stock is off more than 79 percent since oct . 16 , when the company said shareholder equity had been reduced by $ 1 . 2 billion , in part due to partnerships managed by enron ' s former chief financial officer , andrew fastow . at the same time , enron reported a $ 618 million third quarter loss last month , dragged down by a one - time charge of $ 1 . 01 billion attributed to various losses . fastow was ousted a week later . the company ' s financial stability was further weakened after the securities and exchange commission began an inquiry , which was upgraded to a formal investigation , of the partnerships and possible conflicts of interest resulting from them . jeff skilling , enron ' s former chief executive , has been called to testify before the sec , although it remains unclear when that will occur , said denis calabrese , a spokesman for skilling . enron ' s woes have prompted considerable speculation about a possible takeover of the company . before wednesday , companies mentioned as possible suitors included general electric ' s ge capital unit and royal dutch / shell group . duane grubert , an analyst with sanford c . bernstein and co . , said a merger between enron and dynegy makes sense . " i think dynegy could be a very good fit in terms of understanding the merchant business , having a similar culture , " grubert said . " enron was initially proactive at teaming up with non - competitors but once it exhausted that route " it went in another direction . in the past few weeks , enron has cashed in about $ 3 billion in revolving credit it has with various banks to shore up investor confidence . last week , enron secured $ 1 billion in new financing , using some of its natural gas and pipeline assets as collateral . meanwhile , standard & poor ' s corp . on wednesday lowered its ratings on some of enron ' s credit linked notes and placed them on creditwatch . s & p said enron ' s plan to repair its damaged balance sheet through asset sales and other means will be insufficient . moody ' s investors service and fitch inc . have also downgraded the company ' s credit ratings . last week , enron announced it created a special committee headed by university of texas law school dean william powers to respond to the sec investigation . - - - on the net : http : / / www . dynegy . com http : / / www . enron . com copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . usa : wrapup 2 - enron , dynegy in merger talks . by andrew kelly 11 / 07 / 2001 reuters english news service ( c ) reuters limited 2001 . houston , nov 7 ( reuters ) - dynegy inc . is in talks to buy troubled enron corp . in a deal that would involve a stock swap and a $ 1 . 5 billion capital infusion from chevrontexaco , which has a big stake in dynegy , a source close to the talks said on wednesday . the deal , which could be announced officially this week , was expected to give what the source called a " modest premium " to enron shareholders , whose stock has plummeted in value as a fast - moving financial crisis enveloped the company . for dynegy , the merger would catapult it to the top of the energy trading industry now dominated by enron . last year , the company had $ 29 billion in revenues , compared to $ 100 billion for enron . for enron , it would cap an astonishingly rapid fall from grace for a company that not long ago was ballyhooed as one of the world ' s most innovative , not to mention profitable . the source said the form of chevrontexaco ' s capital infusion was not yet clear . chevron , which recently merged with texaco , was one of dynegy ' s founding investors and still owns 26 . 5 percent of the company . stock hammered enron has seen its stock hammered and credit ratings lowered in recent weeks after reporting its first quarterly loss in four years and taking a $ 1 . 2 billion equity writedown linked to financial transactions under investigation by the u . s . securities and exchange commission . enron shares , which traded as high as $ 90 in august of last year , dropped to a 10 - year - low of $ 7 during wednesday ' s trading session before rallying on news of the dynegy talks . the stock ended down 62 cents at $ 9 . 05 on volume of 72 . 4 million shares , the day ' s most active issue on the new york stock exchange . dynegy stock fell $ 3 to $ 33 . enron , the nation ' s largest trader of natural gas and electricity , has been under fire for failing to explain off - balance sheet transactions conducted with partnerships run by ousted chief financial officer andrew fastow . investors said they reeked of conflict of interest and demanded a full explanation they never got . fastow left the company last month in what has become a growing line of high - profile departures from enron , topped by the august resignation of chief executive jeff skilling after just six months on the job . the crisis has undermined confidence in enron ' s financial stability , which in turn has forced the company to seek cash and credit to back the energy trading operations that provide most of its revenue and earnings . the new york times said on wednesday enron had approached at least a dozen buyout firms and investor warren buffett , chairman of berkshire hathaway inc . . , but none took the bait . analysts have said would - be investors are wary because no one knows what financial liabilities , if any , lurk in enron ' s labyrinthine books . firesale but andre meade of commerzbank securities said the firesale price for enron apparently was too attractive to pass up . " certainly , enron at $ 9 a share appeals to some energy companies . dynegy appears to be one of them and is looking at putting something together , " he said . in contrast to dynegy , rival el paso corp . said on wednesday it wanted no part of enron , except perhaps for a few hard assets . el paso also said enron was perhaps neither as big or important to markets as analysts believe . " if enron goes away , which we don ' t think is going to happen and we hope it doesn ' t happen , we don ' t see the market missing a beat , frankly , " ralph eads , head of el paso ' s merchant energy business , told a meeting of analysts . eads said el paso calculates that enron accounts for about 10 percent of trading in u . s . wholesale gas and power , well below the 25 percent usually attributed to them by analysts . at least one company , apache corp . , said it ended some hedging agreements because of concerns about increasing risk in the energy derivatives market caused by the enron crisis . pat wood , chairman of the federal energy regulatory commission , told reporters the agency was keeping an eye on the markets , watching for an enron effect . " we ' re watching the impact that enron or any other firm would have on the overall workings of the market , but we ' re not intervening where other agencies have jurisdiction , " he said . copyright ? 2000 dow jones bloomberg says chevron , which has a 27 % stake in dynegy , will add $ 1 . 5 billion to the deal . the deal is expected to be a stock swap at a small premium to enron ' s wednesday closing price of $ 9 . 05 . enron was off 7 cents in after - hours trading while dynegy was up 34 cents , to $ 33 . 34 . a merger would amount to a rescue of houston energy - trading giant enron , whose stock has plunged nearly 90 % in recent weeks after the company revealed that a shadowy deal caused a $ 1 . 2 billion hit to equity . the controversial deal is under investigation by the securities and exchange commission and has led to the ousting of the company ' s cfo , andrew fastow . the deluge of bad news has prompted other energy companies to reduce their dealings with enron , a serious development for a trading company . dynegy ' s board was meeting wednesday afternoon to discuss the merger , while enron ' s board was scheduled to consider the combination wednesday evening . a dynegy spokesman declined to comment , citing a company policy of not commenting on market rumors . enron spokespersons did not return calls . chevron declined to comment . chevron ' s involvement appears critical if the deal is to gain the approval of rating agencies . dynegy ' s balance sheet is not strong enough to acquire enron on its own . therefore , chevron is expected to raise its stake in dynegy and possibly make an immediate cash infusion into enron . the size of any infusions will be a good indication of how bad things have gotten at enron . with the stock plummeting and enron facing a mounting debt crisis - - $ 12 billion in direct debt and nearly $ 9 billion in potential liabilities from affiliates - - the company is running out of options . it recently drew down about $ 3 billion in existing credit lines and gained an additional $ 1 billion in credit secured by its pipeline business . enron debt has been downgraded in recent days by the three main credit - rating agencies . sources say a number of potential investors have been approached - - from warren buffett ' s berkshire hathaway ( brka : nyse - news - commentary ) to royal dutch / shell ( rd : nyse adr - news - commentary ) - - with little success . ? ? general electric ' s ( ge : nyse - news - commentary ) capital division is said to have held multiple talks with enron with no resolution . ? dynegy may be motivated by its significant exposure to enron . if enron had failed , dynegy could have faced serious disruption and large losses because the two firms are trading partners on a number of contracts . in such a relationship , dynegy could have contracts to purchase a commodity like power or natural gas from enron and be committed to sell that commodity to another buyer . if enron failed to deliver , the domino effect could have a significant economic impact on dynegy . while other energy trading firms have exposure , sources speculate dynegy ' s exposure is more significant than its peers . ? enron was down as much as 20 % during the day . dynegy stock was off 8 % in the regular session , while its bonds also skidded on rumors of a deal . ? ? ? azurix corp . closes sale of azurix north america ? ? 11 / 07 / 2001 ? pr newswire ?

" fiorina , who has claimed the top spot each year since fortune ' s inaugural list in 1998 , heads the biggest company ( $ 48 billion in revenues last year ) run by a woman . and she is still as audacious and impatient as ever . wall street practically heckled her latest move - a bold bet to buy compaq - but fiorina , 47 , remains defiant . in difficult times , " people who drive change are the subject of great scrutiny , " she says . as always , the list is a snapshot of power at a moment in time . last year , power resided in the technology and internet sectors , but that influence was fleeting . gone from the list this year : deborah " hurricane debby " hopkins , who pushed her agenda too ambitiously at lucent and lost her cfo job in may ; ellen hancock , who failed at the startup , exodus ; and morgan stanley ' s mary meeker , who influenced so many to buy into the internet fizz . but one web warrior looks better than ever : meg whitman , no . 2 on the list . she has never overpromised to investors ; instead she has diligently delivered above - target profits every single quarter . fourteen newcomers join the list this year : marce fuller , president louise kitchen , coo , enron americas ; colleen barrett , president betsy bernard , president & ceo , at anne stevens , vp , north america vehicle operations , ford motor ; maria elena lagomasino , chairman susan desmond - hellman , evp and chief medical officer , genentech ; janet robinson , svp , newspaper operations , new york times co . ; carol tomi , evp and cfo , home depot ; carrie cox , evp and president , global prescriptions , pharmacia ; carole black , president and ceo , lifetime television networks ; janet davidson , group president , integrated network solutions , lucent ; larree renda , evp , retail operations , safeway ; and louise francesconi , vp and gm , missile systems , raytheon . while the economy and its points of power change , the criteria we use to evaluate power remains the same . says sellers : " we consider the size and importance of a woman ' s business in the global economy , her clout inside her company , and the arc of her career - where she has been and where she is likely to go . when appropriate , we also weigh the woman ' s influence on mass culture and society . that factor lifts oprah winfrey to no . 3 on this year ' s list . " the shifts on our list this year are dramatic , with 14 newcomers . but one trend is especially intriguing : women are taking on bigger businesses than ever . a few years ago , responsibility for a $ 3 billion business almost automatically earned a woman a spot on this list . no more . this year ' s fortune 50 includes several women who lead businesses with annual revenues of $ 20 billion or more , which is a first . in a related story , " it took a lady to save avon , " katrina brooker looks at andrea jung , chairman and ceo of avon . says brooker , " jung knows what women want and how to sell it to them . and that ' s what has made her one of the most successful ceos - male or female - in recent years . " over the past 20 months she has overhauled nearly everything about the way avon does business : how it advertises , manufactures , packages , and even sells its products , and she has done it not by abandoning the seemingly outdated avon lady , but by reviving her . the result : growth in revenues , operating profits , and operating margins . in addition , fortune includes an international list of the 50 powerful women in business . the top ten , featured in the magazine , are marjorie scardino , ceo , pearson ( britain ) ; anne lauvergeon , chairman , areva ( france ) ; mary ma , senior vp marianne nivert , president lien siaou -

Subject: global standard on valuation methodology changes and model approval sally / beth , as we discussed when i was in houston i have put together a draft on valuation methodology changes and model approval . i had a meeting arranged for today to go through my proposal with ted murphy and tani nath ( she heads up research and structuring here in london ) but ted cancelled at the last minute ( again ) . tani and i met and are broadly in agreement , but before we can go any further we need ted ' s input . he is now away for 2 1 / 2 weeks so there is going to be no further progress on this front . in the mean time i would appreciate your comments on what i have put together . i would prefer it if it is not circulated around houston at this stage until i can accurately say that ted is happy from a global rac perspective . likewise i still need to get houston research comfortable but i am going to wait until ted has had a chance to add his feedback so i can at least say that it is only houston research that is outstanding . others will also need to be consulted ( and i would like to agree a list of key people with you ) but i can ' t see their being any real contention . can you ? i am assuming that resourcing is likely to be an issue for you in houston ( and it may well be here too ) and this has been added to the outstanding list . i am envisaging that some of the risk management work could be completed as part of the curve validation if there are any questions or feedback please let me know . james

Subject: re : lng may 19 decision vince - thanks for the update . what i am not sure of is what if any decision has to be made on may 19 . it seems to me that the mystic lady and elba island deals have already been approved and executed - but it is quite likely i am missing a detail or two . john vince j kaminski 15 / 05 / 2000 17 : 14 to : john sherriff / lon / ect @ ect cc : vince j kaminski / hou / ect @ ect , david gorte / hou / ect @ ect , rick buy / hou / ect @ ect , ted murphy / hou / ect @ ect subject : re : lng may 19 decision john , this is the update on what i have done for the lng transactions . 1 . i was not involved in the lng ship project . i shall read the dash and give you my comments . without looking at the details , i think that the decision to charter a tanker removes one significant risk we have at the elba island project ( please , see point 2 ) . 2 . elba island . i am working with doug rotenberbg , brad hitch , scott earnest ( sally beck ' s organization ) and rac to set up the book for the elba island transaction . the next step will be to expand the book to capture all the enron ' s lng - related positions in one place and to look for natural risk offsets and possible hedges . a working group is meeting to close a few remaining gaps tomorrow ( tuesday ) at 8 : 30 . a few comments on the book design and my view of the project : a . the current thinking is that lng will be sourced for the elba island facility by buying marginal cargos on the fob basis . marginal cargos will represent supply from excess capacity that has not been committed under long - term contracts or became available due to some short - term frictions . the fob cargos are typically selling at a significant discount to the long - term contract prices . the economics of the deal , as represented by the book we are setting up , will reflect the assumption that not only we can locate marginal cargos but that we shall be able to do it on a regular basis , arranging shipping and coordinating the facility schedule and natural gas transactions in the us . in other words , we have a significant logistical and operational risk in this transaction . b . the transaction will cover the period of 17 years ( with an extension option of 5 years ) . even if we can lock - in the lng volumes over this time period , we have no ability to lock - in the other side of the spread ( us gas prices ) for such a long tenor . this is essentially a tolling transaction with exposure to the lng - nat gas spread and i would not recommend locking - in only one leg of the spread . one solution would be to cover , let ' s say , 50 % of he lng volumes for the first 5 years and lock - in the nat gas side on the us market side . c . the book we are setting up will be based on many managerial assumptions regarding sources of lng , shipping rates , schedules , etc . i would set up a big prudence reserve in case we mark it to market . d . my group will work on valuation of some options we have in the elba island deal ( that are good for enron ) and on the hedging strategy for the lng positions . long - term lng contracts are typically based on the japanese crude cocktail that correlates very well with brent . vince john sherriff 05 / 14 / 2000 01 : 40 am to : vince j kaminski / hou / ect @ ect cc : lauren urquhart / lon / ect @ ect subject : lng may 19 decision vince i haven ' t spoken to you for awhile but hope the world is treating you well . anyway with greg moving to his new role i have ( i hope only temporarily ) staff trading oversight for the eastern hemishere plus lng . i understand that your group is taking a first cut at developing curves for lng and lng ship values . i also understand that another lng ship decision is on the dockets for may 19 ( not very far away ) . anway i understand this is a big decision but i still have gotten very little info yet . can you please let me know where you stand now ? i will ask my assistant lauren to set up a time that i can speak with you in the next couple of days and if you have anything for me to review before then she can get it faxed to me as well . look forward to connecting with you vince . john

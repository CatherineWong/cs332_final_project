Subject: gulf plains into tennessee for november i received a call from the plant , apparently , they shorted us 60 dth on the 3 rd of november . however , someone opened the valve on the 20 th and they flowed 69 dth into the pipe without a nomination . the plant is asking if we will phone tennessee and accept allocation of this volume . i realize that it is really not alot of net difference volumetrically , but , the market has been volatile and prices have risen significantly since the nov . 3 rd . i also don ' t know what the market situation is like on tgpl , would we be creating an imbalance on a contract , is there a market to allocate to , are there any potential penalties ? i would like to resolve this today , if at all possible . please advise . mary

Subject: unify performance issues are priority number one most of you are aware that unify experienced some major performance issues as we tried to close out the month of july . not to go into any details but there seemed to be a lot of smaller issues which when combined caused the issues we saw on monday and to a lesser degree on tuesday . almost all of the issues relate to the quirkiness of the current version of sybase which is used for unify ' s database . jeff johnson and his team are putting together a plan that will address most of these issues and hopefully result in acceptable performance as we go through next bidweek and try to close for august . the short term tactical plans include the following : enhancing certain programs which seem to have become resource hogs as the amount of data grows . test and hopefully migrate to the latest version of sybase which will address some of the issues . this may also require some hardware changes as to where we store certain data . we will also need some user help in stress testing prior to moving to production . addressing with the users billing transactions that have never been finaled . i have been told that we still have transactions going back to jan of 99 that have not been finaled or closed out . this puts quite a load on the pma and accrual process since it has to go back to those open transactions to see what if any action should be taken with these transactions . once these changes have been implemented and hopefully bought us a little time to absorb the tremendous growth we ' ve been seeing via eol then we will focus on delivering more intermediate and longer term solutions . these include the following : rewriting most of the code and moving to a 3 tier environment which will be much more scalable . moving off of sybase and on to microsoft sql server or oracle . it will be easier to move microsoft sql server but we have to be sure it is the right solution in the long term . jeff will be following up with some of you to go over a much more detailed plan . needless to say that this is his groups highest priority and his best people are working on these efforts . this will slow down major enhancement efforts such as enhancing the gas applications to handle hourly trades and nominations . we will keep you informed as we start to roll out the tactical solutions . in the mean time feel free to contact me at x - 36858 or jeff at x - 39694 if you have any questions or require additional detail . thanks ! - tommy

Subject: new volatility curve generator for uk power we have established a set of power volatility curves down to the efa / monthly level of detail that can be marked to market up to 6 years out . beyond this , the volatility decays to what we understand to be the long - term level for power volatility , given our understanding of the behaviour of forward prices over large time - scales . the swaption traders can now fit the first 5 - 6 years of the volatility curve to the market - observed baseload swaption implied volatilities ( typically 3 to 12 months duration for the underlying swap ) and then be in a good position to price other swaptions ( including swaptions on individual efa slots ) consistent with the curve . there may also be an impact on the daily var calculation . an illustration of the current volatility curves is pasted below : - these curves will be reset as the market moves , and allow a mark - to - market approach to be followed for our volatility book . the spreadsheet model is saved in t : \ readwrte \ elec _ uk \ models \ . xls and also attached below for houston staff to review .

Subject: erd review here ' s a summary of our conversation so you have points to follow up with . general status of the database model : fix not represented - need to incorporate into common design and standardize - might cause some fix rework . referential integrity not entirely enforced - potential for bad data to develop . snapshots from global databases are currently daily - this can be easily changed to be more frequent , but need to consider implementation as decision on direction of global as a part of commodity logic is made . rate information not developed - need integration with rate server or mkm , preferably mkm . need to define how mkm will be used - whether just for index names or to obtain actual settlement prices or curves as well . application development is not currently occurring on a single version of the database . therefore , some issues could arise as each development team migrates to the standard . this needs to happen relatively quickly . specific issues : gfd _ pipe _ meters _ snp - probably need to add fac _ type ( wh , ite , etc ) for possible use as validation in kx functionality gas _ deal _ location _ dtl - this table refers to facility number rather than pipe and meter . facility number is an enronism that no other company will recognize . pipe and meter general - should try to avoid using pipe _ cd as key . this value needs to be updateable as pipelines are bought and sold . - data for facilities is heavily dependent upon enron global facilities database in current design and functionality - this needs revisiting as the decision surrounding global is made cp _ addr _ vw - this table references only internal _ cp _ id and contact _ type _ cd in conjunction with address _ id . addresses are specific to internal _ cp _ id , product _ cd , deal _ nature _ cd , contact _ type _ cd , and region _ cd . need to add deal nature , product , and region to ensure correct address usage since many companies align their business along these determinants and addresses may vary counterparty - there is a mixture of the usage of global counterparty . some areas indicate a certain amount of independence from enron ' s global counterparty system , by having a table to capture commodity logic information on a counterparty such as phone numbers , credit ratings , etc . this would position cl to become independent at a later date . yet , commodity logic functions as a subset of enron networks and gcp must make entries to indicate the usage of a customer by enron networks to obtain an sap id and support payment processing through to sap . so , cl could not become independent without further functionality or process changes . so why not put the added data requirements within gcp to start with ? if global moves to commodity logic , then this design needs to be revisited for sure . there should probably be some standardization between dependence / independence whether or not cl separates from enron . common data - status is not included in the views being utilized by the applications . i hope the views have been filtered for active status only . show was going to check on this . - concept of mapping others ' codes to ours for processing , is not supported anywhere in these tables . perhaps that has been handled in an isolated manner in the fix design ? this will have to be there for internal release as well as external release . this is critical to the hub concept . i look forward to sitting in on your meetings surrounding these issues . let me know if you have further questions .

Subject: conagra hi guys , i was hoping one of you could help me solve a deal . . . . . the following is my understanding of what happened : on 5 - 2 - 01 ( wednesday ) , conagra called epmi ' s scheduling group about a cut to a day - ahead schedule for he 7 . cara took the call and told conagra that the cut had to be done real - time because it was the day of flow . cara transferred the call to real time . i was wondering if any of you took a call regarding a cut for he 7 to one of our schedules going to conagra ? ( it must have been somewhere at the very beginning of your shift ) . conagra says they talked to a male real time . i find no cut information in the discussion database or in writing and no cuts in enpower . unfortunately , i cannot check the lotus notes schedule information in the database because this day is one of the days that is missing . conagra is charging us $ 6 , 625 . 00 ld ' s for having to resupply themselves . i ' ve asked them to pull their tapes and tell me who they talked to epmi real time . just thought i ' d get the story from our side in the mean time . thanks in advance for any help you can provide . virginia

analysis of teleconnections and their expected impact ; 1 to 5 and 6 to 10 day forecasts compared to earthsat ; a 10 day city forecast table for european cities along with the expected effect on heating demand and finally a " port status report " describing weather and port conditions in 11 worldwide ports . update traders ( uk and wx deriv ) on changes or new trends in the oz models . provide a quality assessment of the uk met 6 to 10 and 1 to 5 day forecast for uk trading . 1330 ( mon - wed ) : brief the crude and products groups in london and houston . 1600 : review 12 z avn for any major forecast changes and communicate changes to traders . weekly : produce a weather article for " critical mass " - internal trading newsletter . of course between 1000 and 1330 we are looking closely at the us weather for support to you guys in houston . i ' m still writing the daily us executive summary as well as producing a 6 to 10 day us forecast . 2 ) requested projects : * gas fundamentals has asked us to provide weather information for their morning report and website . they would like to be able to gather objective output from as many forecast models as we can get . * weather derivatives has asked for week ahead , month ahead , and seasonal outlooks for temperature and precipitation . they have also asked about creating a tradeable " nao index " and developing an in - house model for forecasting nao . * continental power has asked for temperature and precipitation outlooks for power generation and hydro . * gas fundamentals , uk trading , continental power , weather derivatives and crude and products have all asked for a european summer outlook for temperature and precipitation . we expect to have this completed tomorrow . * the research group has asked for assistance in gathering climate data across spain for temperature and precipitation . 3 ) leads to follow up on : * elsa in houston asked us to contact some of the softs traders here and let them know once we were up and running . * contact chris mahoney to determine if we can provide and additional support for crude and products . * follow up on a potential morning breifing for continental power 4 ) challenges : * we ' ve been told that we will be moving locations next week - which might entail corrupting or loosing the software and hardware configurations that have taken almost a week to get fully established . it seems that this office functions on a " hot desk " system where people are constantly moving around . this will make it very difficult to stay connected - as well as very difficult for our customers to identify us . * administrative detail take an inordinate amount of time . assembling reports both physical and electronic can take nearly as long as actually preparing the reports ! - - - mike , ok - i think that brings you up to speed . i ' ve been amazed at the amount of feedback we ' ve already gotten and we ' ve only been here 3 days ! on that note i wanted to let you know that i am fully committed to this project . it seems that we will not have a second meteorologist to assist tony by my planned departure date on the 20 th . as such - i can continue in my current role through my planned vacation - keeping me in london until the 27 th - which is my current reservation back to houston . i am also open to remaining in london beyond the 27 th to ensure the success of this project . hopefully this gives you a good idea as to what ' s gone on in the first few days here . we look forward to talking to you later today and with you and vince tomorrow .

" our long - term strategy to focus on marketing and trading around physical assets supports earnings sustainability , " chairman and chief executive officer chuck watson said in a statement . " i would say the company ' s ability to continuously post strong earnings growth illustrates their ability to successfully navigate through wildly various operating environments , " ubs warburg analyst jay yannello said . " this company has rapidly emerged as the leading player in its field . " while stocks in its sector have been hammered sharply over the past six months , dynegy has been a better performer than similar companies . dynegy ' s stock this year has fallen some 15 percent , outperforming the standard & poor ' s utilities index , which has lost 21 percent . despite the strong earnings growth , shares of dynegy were down $ 1 . 02 , or 2 . 34 percent , to $ 42 . 63 in monday afternoon trading . analysts cited rumors that the california public utilities commission ( cpuc ) wants to renegotiate the power purchase contracts that the california department of water resources holds with companies like dynegy , calpine corp . , mirant corp . and williams cos . inc . . a spokesman for the department of water resources , however , said it doesn ' t plan to renegotiate the deals . " these companies renegotiate contracts all the time . the question is , do they maintain value in the contracts or do they lose value in the contracts ? " said analyst jeff dietert of simmons and co . " and i think the assumption that the market is making is that dynegy and others would lose value in their contracts . " dynegy still has an accounts receivable balance of about $ 320 to $ 325 million for power it produced for cash - challenged california utilities . " we ' re not out of the woods yet , " said president and chief operating officer stephen bergstrom on a conference call . but he noted there could be some resolution by the second or third quarter of next year . after all , pg & e corp . ' s pacific and gas electric utility sought bankruptcy in april and filed a reorganization plan on sept . 20 . edison international ' s southern california edison utility plans to pay off its creditors by march , under a settlement it reached with the cpuc . wholesale income nearly doubles dynegy marketing and trade , the company ' s main wholesale business , reported an 85 percent year - over - year increase in recurring net income , taking in $ 263 million this year compared with $ 142 million in the comparable quarter in 2000 . among other things , dynegy trades wholesale natural gas , power , coal , emission allowances and weather derivatives . the company attributed part of its improved performance this quarter to better results in european and canadian operations , including increased gas marketing in canada . north american natural gas volumes grew 12 percent to 11 . 0 billion cubic feet per day ( bcf / d ) in the quarter , rising from 9 . 8 bcf / d in the year - earlier period . total physical power sales increased 86 percent to 90 . 5 million megawatt hours ( mwh ) in the 2001 third quarter , compared with 48 . 7 million mwh in the same quarter a year ago . dynegydirect , the company ' s online trading platform for more than 750 products and services , recorded nearly $ 10 billion in transactions in the third quarter , the company said . since its birth in november 2000 , dynegydirect has recorded $ 33 billion in transactions . dynegy recently expanded the platform , its answer to hometown rival enron corp . ' s wildly successful enrononline trading platform , into british energy markets . one nominally lower performer this year was illinois power , dynegy ' s regulated transmission and distribution subsidiary . it reported recurring net income of $ 26 million versus $ 27 million a year earlier . dynegy attributed the smaller figure to a reduced industrial load . the company ' s new communications segment took a $ 15 million loss for the quarter , mostly from costs associated with developing its 16 , 000 - mile network . the network reaches 44 u . s . cities and is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter . dynegy expects that segment to record a fourth - quarter loss of nil to 3 cents a share and a full - year loss of 13 cents to 16 cents a share . for 2002 , the company expects the unit to be at breakeven by the end of the year .

" enron has consistently said that it believes its dealings with the fastow - related partnerships were proper and properly disclosed . the company has said it put billions of dollars of assets and stock into partnership - related transactions as a way to hedge against fluctuating market conditions . the sec inquiry came from the agency ' s fort worth , texas , regional office . according to a person familiar with the matter , this would indicate that the inquiry comes from the sec ' s enforcement arm , as opposed to its corporate - finance section . the participation of the enforcement branch would indicate that the agency is looking into whether there were possible violations of securities law . however , enforcement - branch inquiries often don ' t produce any allegations of wrongdoing . it also appears that the sec hasn ' t yet taken the step of launching a formal investigation , which would be a sign that the agency believes securities laws might have been violated . the sec declined to comment . certainly , there have been questions and concerns about those partnership transactions , which contributed to a $ 1 . 2 billion reduction in shareholder equity last week as part of enron ' s efforts to unwind the deals . mr . fastow , who has declined repeated interview requests , resigned from the partnerships , known as ljm cayman lp and ljm 2 co - investment lp , in late july in the face of rising conflict - of - interest concerns by wall street analysts and major company investors . since then , internal partnership documents have shown that mr . fastow and perhaps a handful of enron associates made millions of dollars last year in fees and capital increases as general partner of the ljm 2 , the larger of the two partnerships . mr . fastow ' s partnership arrangement caused some unhappiness inside enron , according to people familiar with the matter . for instance , these people say , sometime after the creation of the partnerships in 1999 , enron treasurer jeffrey mcmahon went to company president jeffrey skilling and complained about potential conflicts of interest posed by mr . fastow ' s activities . mr . skilling didn ' t share mr . mcmahon ' s concern , these people say , and mr . mcmahon requested and received reassignment to another post . mr . skilling resigned as enron president and chief executive in mid - august , citing personal reasons and the fall in enron ' s stock price , which peaked at about $ 90 a share last year . mr . mcmahon and mr . skilling haven ' t responded to repeated interview requests . investors are also concerned about potential problems arising in enron ' s dealings with other related entities . in some cases , enron could be required to issue large amounts of stock to noteholders in some of the entities if certain so - called double trigger provisions occur . for example , last july enron helped create the marlin water trust ii , which sold $ 915 million in notes that are due july 15 , 2003 . however , enron can be considered in default , in advance of that date , if its stock price falls below $ 34 . 13 for three trading days and its senior debt is downgraded to below investment grade by either moody ' s investors service or standard & poor ' s . currently , enron debt is still investment - grade at both ratings agencies and would have to be lowered by several notches to fall into a noninvestment grade category . last week , moody ' s put enron on review for a possible downgrade . however , observers believe that even if moody ' s lowers enron ' s rating , the company will still be investment - grade . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . october 23 , 2001 where did the value go at enron ? by floyd norris new york times what really went on in some of the most opaque transactions with insiders ever seen ? wall street has been puzzling over that since enron ( news / quote senior columnist thestreet . com 10 / 22 / 2001 07 : 15 am edt url : enron is trying to improve disclosure to investors , but its decision to reduce equity by $ 1 . 2 billion in the third quarter has created dismay and confusion in the market . the action was disclosed in a dubiously discreet manner . more important , investors are struggling to pinpoint how the shrinkage will affect enron ' s balance sheet , profits and earnings guidance . enron didn ' t provide answers to questions submitted on the equity reduction . enron doesn ' t include a balance sheet in its earnings release , so the equity decrease couldn ' t be spotted in numbers supplied tuesday . and even though enron did break out $ 1 billion in earnings charges in its release , the company didn ' t feel it necessary to mention the equity write down anywhere in the text . instead , the public first heard about it on a tuesday conference call . ceo kenneth lay said enron had shrunk its equity as a result of terminating a so - called " structured finance arrangement . " the wall street journal later reported that enron ' s counter - party in this transaction was an investment partnership called ljm 2 co - investment , which has set up and run by enron ' s finance chief , andrew fastow . this is what lay said on the tuesday call about the equity move : " in connection with the early termination , shareholders ' equity will be reduced approximately $ 1 . 2 billion , with a corresponding significant reduction in the number of diluted shares outstanding . " according to the journal , lay then said wednesday on another call that enron had repurchased 55 million shares . enron ' s supporters count lay ' s mention of a reduction in the share count as bullish , because it should boost earnings per share numbers in the future . but there are two possible problems with this theory . first , enron affirmed its previous earnings guidance that it expects to make $ 2 . 15 per share in operating earnings next year . critically , the company did not say whether its guidance was given using a share count without the 55 million shares or not . if the forecast does assume the exclusion of the 55 million shares , the company should have upped its 2002 per - share earnings forecast by around 6 % , since that ' s the amount by which the share count will be reduced . enron needs to say what share count it ' s using in its guidance . second , it ' s almost impossible to determine where these shares were ever recorded , casting a certain amount of doubt on lay ' s assertion that the share count will come down . why question the ceo ? well , in its 2000 annual report , enron included some disclosure of the 55 million shares connected with ljm 2 . it reads : " at december 31 , 2000 , enron had derivative instruments . . . on 54 . 8 million shares of enron common stock . " the derivative instruments appear to be types of options , or agreements that give the counterparty the right to buy or sell stock at agreed prices . but these derivatives - linked shares don ' t show up where they should in the annual report : in the table that breaks out the difference between the basic and diluted share counts . the line item in this table that shows options - related shares totals only 43 million shares , which is close to the amount of employee pay options that qualified for inclusion . therefore , that number almost certainly doesn ' t include the 55 million ljm 2 - related shares . the fact is , at least some of the 55 million derivatives - linked shares should be included if the derivatives were like normal options . that ' s because the ljm 2 derivatives appear to have been " in the money " , or profitable for the holders . typically , all in - the - money options - based stock has to be included in the diluted share count . and these ljm 2 derivatives did appear to have that status at the end of 2000 . back then , enron stock was trading around $ 80 , way above the average $ 68 level at which these derivatives made money for ljm 2 . maybe these weren ' t simple options and had other conditions attached that excluded them from the diluted share count . that ' s what disclosure elsewhere in the annual report appears to imply . alternatively , the options were embedded somewhere else in the share count table or equity disclosure , though it ' s hard think where . presumably , investors will get a full explanation in enron ' s quarterly financial results filing with the securities and exchange commission , due by the middle of november .

" the market is really shrugging off this news , " said mark donahoe , a managing director at u . s . bancorp piper jaffray . upbeat earnings news from american express , released monday afternoon , seemed to give stocks an additional lift . investors may be shifting their focus away from concerns about anthrax exposure and u . s . military maneuvers in afghanistan to take a closer look at quarterly earnings results , said steven kroll sr . , managing director at monness , crepsi & hardt . the uncertainty on the global front " looks like it is going to be a long , drawn - out affair , " mr . kroll said . " i think stocks will revert back to being earnings - driven . " although dismal by ordinary standards , last week ' s flood of quarterly earnings reports got a reasonably upbeat reception from investors , who seem to have approached them with extremely low expectations . " the markets acted pretty well last week in light of some very ugly earnings , " said mr . donahoe of u . s . bancorp . that resilience might be giving hope to investors this week , he added . still , investors will be carefully sifting through quarterly results in the coming week to get a fix on how the fourth quarter is shaping up , mr . kroll argued . third - quarter earnings showed several pockets of strength on monday , with big companies such as minnesota mining and manufacturing and u . s . steel posting results that met or topped analysts ' estimates . the dow industrials got an additional boost shortly after 2 p . m . edt when index component american express reported earnings that , excluding certain items , beat wall street previously lowered estimates . the financial - services concern posted net income of $ 298 million , or 22 cents a share , down 60 % from $ 737 million , or 54 cents a share , a year earlier . excluding charges related to a corporate restructuring and the september 11 attacks , american express said it would have earned $ 595 million , or 45 cents a share , for the latest quarter . analysts had been expecting earnings of 30 cents a share , according to thomson financial / first call . shares of american express surged after the quarterly earnings release , closing up 3 . 4 % at $ 30 . 32 . chip stocks helped lead the nasdaq composite higher , with the philadelphia semiconductor index gaining 5 . 4 % . the rally seemed to be a continuation of friday ' s gains in the sector , sparked by positive earnings news from kla - tencor . u . s . steel , the nation ' s no . 1 steelmaker , said it swung to a third - quarter loss from a profit a year earlier , hurt by oversupply and a weak economy . but excluding charges related to the closure of one mill and damage at another , u . s . steel said its loss was much narrower than what was forecast by analysts surveyed by thomson financial / first call . shares of u . s . steel rose 9 . 7 % to $ 14 . 74 . investors also sent 3 m shares nearly 5 % higher after the maker of chemical and adhesive products squeaked by wall street estimates , despite a 21 % decline in net income . and oil producers conoco and usx - marathon group handily beat analysts ' forecasts . but not all the earnings news was cheery . local phone company sbc communications recorded net income that was slightly below estimates . shares of sbc , a component of the dow industrials , fell 5 . 1 % to $ 41 . 40 . meanwhile , the outlook for corporate profits in the fourth quarter seems discouraging , some analysts noted . on monday , 3 m guided wall stret ' s earnings expectations lower for the upcoming quarter , and a top executive at u . s . steel told analysts that the company ' s fourth quarter would be " difficult . " companies " are meeting third quarter expectations , but they are talking down the fourth quarter , " said mr . kroll of monness crespi & hardt . he said that some of the rise in monday ' s markets might be a carryover from friday ' s buying activity related to the expiration of u . s . stock option and index option contracts , an event known as " double witching . " one of the hardest - hit stocks on monday was enron , an energy concern that said that the securities and exchange commission was seeking information about certain complex transactions it undertook with a limited partnership organized by its chief financial officer . shares of enron plunged 21 % to $ 20 . 65 . overseas , stocks closed higher . london ' s financial times - stock exchange 100 - share index gained 1 . 1 % , while frankfurt ' s xetra dax index rose 2 % . earlier in the day , japan ' s nikkei 225 average closed with a gain of 0 . 3 % , but hong kong ' s hang seng index ended 0 . 3 % lower . in economic news , the conference board reported that its index of leading indicators for the month fell 0 . 5 % in september , matching the estimates of economists surveyed by thomson global markets . the index - - a composite of measurements aimed at forecasting likely changes in the economy - - included some data gathered after the sept . 11 attacks . the decline , which was the index ' s largest one - month drop since january 1996 , confirmed that the widespread weakness in the u . s . economy is deepening , the conference board said . falling stock prices and rising initial unemployment claims were two of the index components that contributed most negatively to the september reading . in august , the leading - indicators index slipped 0 . 1 % , less than the previous estimate of a 0 . 3 % decline . even so , the back - to - back declines paint a bleak economic picture , said conference board economist ken goldstein . the two - month decline in the index suggests that the already - weak economy is likely to remain weak into next year , mr . goldstein said . the overall reading from these numbers indicates that manufacturing and services are experiencing a significant slowdown . in major u . s . market action : stocks rose . on the big board , where 1 . 09 billion shares were traded , 1 , 813 stocks rose and 1 , 291 fell . on the nasdaq , 1 . 49 billion shares changed hands . bonds were mixed . the 10 - year treasury note rose less than 1 / 16 point monday , or 62 . 5 cents for each $ 1 , 000 invested . the yield , which moves inversely to its price , fell to 4 . 618 % . the 30 - year bond fell 1 / 16 point to yield 5 . 364 % . the dollar rose . the dollar bought 122 . 56 yen , compared with 121 . 20 yen late friday . the euro traded at 89 . 18 u . s . cents , down from 89 . 84 cents late friday . copyright ( c ) 2001 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . copyright ?

" related party transactions " is the heading used by enron in its 1999 and 2000 annual reports to discuss dealings with its limited partnerships , ljm cayman lp and the larger ljm 2 co - investment lp , which engaged in complex hedging transactions involving company assets worth hundreds of millions of dollars . fastow severed his ties to the partnerships in june . ljm was set up in june 1999 for energy - related investments , and ljm 2 in december 1999 for energy - and communication - related investments . the journal reported $ 35 million of its third - quarter loss of $ 638 million were connected with the limited partnerships curt launer , an analyst at credit suisse first boston , said investors should question enron ' s use of real value accounting when the value of certain assets , " most notably in telecommunications , " have declined precipitously .

" the partnerships were set up two years ago , and while the company maintains that they are perfectly proper , some have suggested that it is a conflict of interest for enron ' s chief financial officer to be involved in a partnership that was looking to purchase enron assets , the journal reported . the energy company said its auditors reviewed the arrangements and its board was fully informed and approved the deals , which were disclosed in sec filings .

' s shares fell 21 percent after the houston - based company said the securities and exchange commission requested information on partnerships run by chief financial officer andrew fastow and other executives . enron , the largest energy trader , created partnerships and other affiliated companies to buy and sell assets such as power plants to lower the debt on its books . an investor sued enron ' s board wednesday , saying two partnerships cost the company $ 35 million and fastow ' s leadership of them was a conflict of interest . investors today said they were concerned that enron may be forced to dismantle the affiliated companies by paying off the owners in cash or stock . chief executive ken lay said last week he may be have to ` ` unravel ' ' agreements that created the companies if enron ' s debt ratings fall too far . ` ` we need confidence their long - term credit rating won ' t go below investment grade , ' ' said roger hamilton , an analyst at john hancock ' s value funds , which own 600 , 000 enron shares . enron reduced shareholders ' equity by $ 1 . 2 billion when it repurchased 55 million shares of two such partnerships controlled by fastow , ljm cayman and lmj 2 co - investment , the wall journal reported last week . dismantling more of the affiliated companies and partnerships would cost enron or its shareholders as much as $ 3 billion , ray niles , a salomon smith barney analyst , wrote in a report to investors today . enron shares fell $ 5 . 40 to $ 20 . 65 . they touched $ 19 . 67 during the day ' s trading , the lowest level since jan . 15 , 1998 . shares plunge the stock has fallen 75 percent this year amid concerns about failed investments in trading of space on fiber - optic communications networks and a water company , and the resignation of jeff skilling as ceo in august after seven months on the job . while skilling said he resigned for personal reasons , investors say his departure led them to question whether the company was concealing problems , including possible liabilities from affiliated companies . on tuesday , enron surprised many investors when it reported a $ 618 million third - quarter loss , the result of writing off $ 1 . 01 billion in failed investments . moody ' s investors service placed the company ' s debt on watch for possible downgrade . the company ' s debt is rated at investment grade by fitch , standard & poor ' s and moody ' s . the company received a faxed request for information from the sec on wednesday asking for information , spokesman mark palmer said , and will respond ` ` as soon as possible .

' ' shipman said . ` ` investors are worried they might have to share their enron earnings with a lot more people than they originally thought . ' ' worrisome financing enron ' s auditors and attorneys reviewed the company ' s ` ` related party arrangements , ' ' the board approved them , and they were disclosed in sec filings , enron said in its statement . that hasn ' t eased concerns . the reduction of shareholder equity by $ 1 . 2 billion from the ljm partnerships is reason to worry about enron ' s other financing vehicles , wrote niles , the salomon analyst . enron also may take another $ 2 . 4 billion in losses from investments in the dabhol power plant in india and projects in south america , he wrote . enron ' s 8 percent coupon bonds due in 2005 fell $ 34 per $ 1 , 000 face value to be offered at $ 1 , 022 today from $ 1 , 056 on friday , traders said . yield on the debt rose to 7 . 33 percent from 6 . 33 percent . based on bloomberg composite ratings , most of enron ' s long - term debt is rated at bbb 2 and bbbl , two or three levels above investment grade . fastow continues to work , and enron hasn ' t punished him , palmer said . fastow declined to be interviewed , spokeswoman karen denne said . sec spokesman john heine declined to comment on the agency ' s request to enron . ` ` we believe everything that needed to be considered and done in connection with these transactions was considered and done , ' ' lay said in the statement . uniprime signs letter of intent for wind energy park project 10 / 22 / 2001 business wire ( copyright ( c ) 2001 , business wire ) apache junction , ariz . - - ( business wire ) - - oct . 22 , 2001 - - uniprime capital corporation inc .

Subject: duke energy field deal 157288 8 / 00 daren : i am taking over the duke account from katherine and am having trouble with 8 / 00 production . it looks like we have some spot deals included in the exchange deal 157288 . i think days 9 - 31 , which are priced at gd - 0 . 10 , need to be moved to a new ticket if they are spot . let me know if you agree . also , can you confirm for me that days 8 / 5 and 8 / 6 are suppose to be exchange ? the sale volume for those two days was zero , so there was no exchange . we have not received any statements from duke yet , so there is nothing to verify our volumes . you may also want to look at sept . 2000 for deal 157288 . it looks like spot deals are being included in the exchange deal . those will need to be moved to a new ticket if they are spot . thanks , megan

Subject: re : var vince thanks for the update - especially your point 3 which echoes our own discussion yesterday : i want to clarify responsibilities for maintenance and administration of var . we need transparency around the process so that mapping decisions , for example , are easily made , supported and reviewed . it became clear after last friday ' s events , that we are in an awkward paradigm with respect to how we handle var here , particularly at " pressure points " . i am putting together the scope of a " general overhaul " of the var process , including method and administration , to which i hope we would all buy in , so be assured of our co - operation . dp - - - - - original message - - - - - from : kaminski , vince sent : wednesday , april 11 , 2001 2 : 49 pm to : port , david cc : lavorato , john ; kaminski , vince ; tamarchenko , tanya subject : var david , during today ' s var coordination meeting we had a discussion of issues related to mapping of the forward price curves into core locations . mapping is a necessity dictated by the limitations of the computer system : we have to reduce the dimensionality of the problem to stay within the bounds of available cpu memory . also , in some cases the quality of price discovery is poor and it ' s difficult to model the price curves independently : we solve the problem by mapping them into more liquid and better behaved core locations curves . we have agreed on the following : 1 . winston will investigate the it side and determine to what extent we can increase the number of forward price curves that are simulated as basic ( core ) curves . he will investigate the impact of a larger number of the core curves on the time required to complete the var run . 2 . the curves associated with the biggest 10 - 20 positions in each commodity should be modeled as core curves ( i . e . no mapping into other locations ) . it makes sense to monitor the biggest risks separately and avoid aggregating them into less transparent aggregates . 3 . the results of an automated clustering ( mapping ) procedures should be systematically monitored by a human and corrected if they misrepresent the risks of the trading positions . this responsibility should be vested with one person ( right now the responsibility is dispersed through the organization and this means in practice that nobody is responsible ) . research can allocate one person to this task ; cooperation of trading and rac will be critical . vince

Subject: how do officialized books make it to credit ? in the past few months much focus has been put on understanding var and how it is calculated ( through risktrac ) . however , everyone should note that the credit department also receives our information . market risk and credit risk are inherently different , with different requirements . this memo serves as a reminder of what some of the key differences are , how the credit system uses risktrac differently from market risk , how this affects us , what some key problems are in the credit system caused by our data , and changes to be made by risk management groups . differences are between credit and market risk - you all know this , but many of your ba ' s don ' t . when a book is flat it still has an effect on credit . flat books must be officialized market risk is keyed off positions and curves . when we make money , market risk is reduced . credit risk is keyed off positions with customers . when we make money , credit risk is increased , as people owe us more money . how the credit system uses risktrac differently from market risk market risk picks up all officialized books . if a book is not officialized it does not pick the book up . credit picks up all officalized books . if a book is not officialized , it picks up the previous day ' s position . therefore , if positions in book a are moved to book b , and a is no longer officialized , credit picks up the previous day ' s position for book a . as a result , if a book is no longer used , please officialize it the first day it is no longer used , so credit will pick up 0 on a go forward basis . market risk is not concerned with counterparty codes and names . credit needs correct counterparty codes and names . in recent months , the counterparty information has deteriorated . enron official counterparty names need to be used so they flow properly to credit . what are some key problems in the credit system caused by our data as referenced above : correct counterparty names and books with 0 positions not being officialized so credit picks up previous day info . as a takeaway from this message please ensure only correct counterparty names are used and that if a book has 0 positions that it is officialized the first day it has 0 positions . if you have specific questions about credit , please call debbie brackett , at x 35856 .

( dyn ) and enron corp . ( ene ) will face a complicated and time - consuming regulatory - review process , legal experts said thursday . any equity deal would require approvals from numerous u . s . federal regulatory agencies and state utility regulators , as well as survive canadian and european antitrust reviews , energy attorneys contacted by dow jones newswires said . a merger would require approvals from the federal energy regulatory commission , securities and exchange commission , department of justice and federal trade commission . and the illinois commerce commission likely would weigh into the mix , since dynegy owns illinova ' s illinois power co . any effort to strike a deal quickly also could be complicated by enron ' s ownership of portland general electric co . while enron has entered into an agreement to sell the utility to northwest natural gas co . ( nwn ) , a previous attempt to sell the company fell through because of regulatory complications . a key issue for federal regulators scrutinizing a potential enron - dynegy merger will be the degree of electricity market concentration such a transaction would entail , the attorneys said . financially wounded enron is the nation ' s largest electricity and natural gas trader with an extensive network of gas pipelines . dynegy is ranked sixth nationally in both electricity and natural gas marketing . the transaction would receive the greatest scrutiny at ferc , where the merger application would challenge the commission ' s merger - review policy , attorneys said . copyright ?

" we believe that the information we have made available addresses a number of the concerns that have been raised by our shareholders and the sec about these matters , " he said . analysts , wary after last month ' s surprise revelations , said enron may have more to release , but they were pleased it was finally coming forth with information .

" there are people out there with the experience and the contacts who see this time as a good opportunity to get into the market , " a senior metals market source told reuters on thursday . such a move for enron ' s metals portfolio would involve the acquisition of an existing organisation as a vehicle , the source added . " we do not comment on rumours , " an enron spokeswoman said , declining further comment . other enron metals assets were also said to be in play , including the henry bath warehousing company , which operates lme - registered warehouses in the uk , the netherlands , singapore and the united states . major player houston - based enron became a major player in the metals trade in may last year when it acquired mg plc , a leading independent international metals dealing firm in london , in a deal worth around 300 million pounds . the company is a ring - dealing member of the london metal exchange ( lme ) , able to participate in open - outcry floor trade , and is active in screen - based metals trade via its enrononline platform ( www . enrononline . com ) . the company no longer has a stake in online metals trading platform emetra ( www . emetra . com ) , having sold its holding to other emetra shareholders this summer . but while enron may be a heavy hitter in the metals sector , base metals trading could hardly be regarded as one of its core businesses . the company ' s third - quarter 2001 results statement shows income before interest , minority interests and taxes ( ibit ) from " europe and other commodity markets " - which includes metals and steel alongside european gas and power , among others - of $ 53 million , unchanged from the year - earlier period . this compares with ibit from enron ' s gas and power market - making operations and merchant energy activities in north and south america of $ 710 million over the same period . but the third - quarter figure that has slashed the value of the company ' s shares is a $ 1 . 2 billion write - down of shareholder equity related to off - balance sheet transactions . on thursday the company said it would restate its earnings for 1997 to 2001 to reflect the transactions - a move which wipes $ 613 million of the company ' s reported net income from 1997 through the first half of this year . the company ' s stock has dropped by almost 78 percent since enron released its earnings results on october 16 , falling to nine - year lows amid concerns about the company ' s ability to raise cash . the story added an extra twist on wednesday as news broke that u . s . - based energy trading and marketing firm dynegy inc . was in talks to buy out enron . against this background speculation is rife about the future of the metals operation , fuelled by the company ' s decision last month to trim between 10 and 20 percent of its metals workforce as part of a wider staff reduction by enron europe . unlikely to remain intact any decision by enron or a possible future purchaser to offload its metals operations would be unlikely to see enron metals remain intact , traders said . " they paid $ 450 million for mg . would they get $ 450 million for enron metals ? i don ' t think so , " said one . " why buy the whole concern when you can cherry - pick the best traders and the clients will follow ? " added another . an increasing emphasis on screen trading at the expense of personal contacts may already have persuaded some enron clients to jump ship . " we ' ve picked up a fair amount of small and mid - sized trade - type business in europe from people who ' ve said ' i ' m not going to be told just to trade on a screen , ' " said one trader . another trader said : " a lot of this business revolves around who you ' ve been trading with and talking to over a period of time . it ' s about individuals , " he said . " enron online . . . should be seen as an ' added value ' product , not as the only way of trading . customers still want to talk to their broker , and are willing to pay commission for the service , " the senior source said . enron ' s financial position could also prompt customers to consider other options , the first trader said . " as a customer , you want to place your business where there ' s financial stability . if a company isn ' t financially stable , you ' ll move elsewhere . " enron ' s trade counterparties are also keeping a close eye on the company ' s financial situation , said a trader at one lme brokerage . " people aren ' t particularly concerned about short - term trading ( with enron ) , but when it comes to otc business done outside the clearing market they ' re backing off a bit , " he said .

' ' dynegy ` ` is unlikely to pay significantly more than enron ' s current share price if it does make a bid , ' ' he said . shares decline enron shares declined 40 cents to $ 8 . 65 after the company determined it violated generally accepted accounting rules when it failed to consolidate results for three so - called special purpose entities , vehicles for getting access to capital or hedging risk that can be moved off the books under some circumstances . enron ousted fastow last month after revealing an accounting error for transactions with a group of the partnerships resulted in a $ 1 . 2 billion reduction in shareholder equity in the third quarter . arthur andersen llp was enron ' s independent auditor . the company today reduced 1997 net income by $ 96 million , 1998 earnings by $ 113 million , 1999 results by $ 250 million , and 2000 earnings by $ 132 million . in 2001 , the changes resulted in an increase to net income of $ 17 million in the first quarter and $ 5 million in the second quarter , and a reduction of $ 17 million for the third quarter . enron bonds pared gains after the earnings were restated , as the threat of a credit downgrade dimmed a rally sparked by the dynegy talks . enron ' s debt doubled in the past four years to $ 13 billion at the end of the third quarter . both standard & poor ' s and moody ' s investors service are considering lowering their ratings , which are two levels above junk . ` ` enron is running out of time and that ' s what ' s pushing them to the bargaining table , ' ' said zach wagner , an analyst with edward jones joint energy development investments , known as jedi ; and a wholly owned subsidiary of ljml that ` ` engaged in derivative transactions with enron to permit enron to hedge market risks of an equity investment in rhythms netconnections inc . , ' ' which provides high - speed networking to businesses . some companies that trade natural gas , electricity and other commodities with enron may pull back if enron ' s finances deteriorate to the point that it loses its investment - grade credit rating , investors say . atlanta - based mirant corp . , a top u . s . energy trader , has moved most of its trades away from enron to other exchanges , such as intercontinenal exchange , a venture it formed in march 2000 with other partners including bp plc and goldman , sachs & co . , mirant spokesman james peters said . ` ` we are still trading with them , but on a very limited basis , ' ' said peters . ` ` dynegy has to act fast , ' ' said roger hamilton , a money manager with john hancock advisers inc . , which sold its enron shares in recent weeks . ` ` if enron can ' t get financing and its bonds go to junk , they lose counterparties and their marvelous business vanishes . ' ' dynegy would gain a wholesale energy business , the leading energy manager for commercial and small - industrial customers , and an internet energy trading operation many times larger than its own , said ubs warburg llc analyst james yanello . ` ` if history is any guide , dynegy is stingy when it comes to acquisitions , so i don ' t expect them to do anything stupid ' ' such as overpaying for enron , said yanello . ` ` a deal could provide dynegy with tremendous opportunity . ' ' he rates dynegy ` ` strong buy ' ' and doesn ' t own shares of either company . chevrontexaco corp . , which owns about 27 percent of dynegy , is considering adding $ 1 . 5 billion to the transaction to help enron . it would provide another $ 1 billion when the purchase is closed , the new york times and wall street journal reported . breakup fee the companies agreed on a breakup fee providing dynegy with about $ 400 million if enron accepts a higher offer , people familiar with the talks said . dynegy ' s shares rose as much as $ 4 . 30 , or 13 percent , to $ 37 . 30 . the stock had dropped $ 3 yesterday when news of the enron talks was first reported . dynegy spokesman steve stengel , enron spokesman mark palmer and chevrontexaco spokesman fred gorell declined to comment . enron plans to meet with j . p . morgan chase financial results to be restated cbsmarketwatch . com lisa sanders new york ( cbs . mw ) - - enron ' s troubles deepened thursday as the energy merchant confirmed it ' s in merger talks with dynegy and announced , in a securities and exchange commission filing , that it fired two officers and is restating financial results for four years and two quarters . both dynegy and enron confirmed thursday that they ' re in negotiations following a published report that an $ 8 billion deal was close to being finalized . the new york times reported that dynegy ' s board approved a stock offer worth $ 10 a share for enron . while confirming the talks , the companies released no further details . dynegy had no additional comment . an enron spokeswoman stonewalled reporters thursday by saying the company was requiring all questions to be submitted in writing . enron did not respond to the questions . shares of enron ( ene ) initially rallied but closed at $ 8 . 41 , down 64 cents , or 7 . 1 percent , while dynegy ( dyn ) tacked on $ 3 . 50 to close at $ 36 . 50 . chevrontexaco ( cvx ) , which owns 27 percent of dynegy , will contribute $ 2 . 5 billion to the deal , the times reported . chevrontexaco , which added 31 cents to close at $ 87 . 59 , declined to comment . also thursday , enron in an sec filing said it has fired its treasurer , ben glisan , and the general counsel of an enron division , kristina mordaunt . earlier in the month , enron fired chief financial officer andy fastow for his role in limited partnerships that are now under investigation by the sec . enron restated its financial results for the years 1997 through 2000 and the first two quarters of 2001 . enron has lost most of its market value over the past month after the sec launched a probe of some transactions by company executives . enron would bring huge debt a merger of dynegy and enron would require the smaller company to take on the $ 12 . 8 billion in debt that ' s now on enron ' s books . the acquisition would likely lead to the sale of additional enron assets to pay down the debts , the times reported . boards of both companies were meeting in houston on wednesday night , according to the paper . " if you look at the balance sheets of dynegy and enron , ( a merger ) would be a tough deal , " jeff dietert of simmons & co . he noted that dynegy ( dyn ) has $ 3 billion worth of debt and a market capitalization of $ 11 . 7 billion . " enron ' s debt load is likely to be too significant for dynegy to step up and swallow , " dietert said . for dynegy to make the deal , it would have to issue equity , he added . it would make more sense for dynegy to consider buying some enron assets , dietert said . that would also help enron clean up its balance sheet . chris ellinghaus of williams capital group said that chevrontexaco ' s involvement would make a dynegy - enron combination more realistic . " we would view this transaction favorably assuming dynegy intends to dispose of enron ' s myriad of non - core businesses , " ellinghaus said . dynegy and enron together would dwarf other natural gas and power marketers in the u . s . ellinghaus said the possibility that dynegy would buy enron is " staggering . " " however , the failure of enron to procure an outside equity infusion has apparently severely limited enron ' s options , " he said . " we do not believe the potential demise of enron invalidates the merchant energy model or suggest deeper problems within the wholesale energy markets . " gregory phelps , vice president and portfolio manager of john hancock ' s patriot group of closed - end income funds , said enron , even in its current state , retains some intrinsic value . " enron still has an incredible number of contractual trading arrangements out there that can ' t be allowed to crumble and fall , " he added . " i think that a firm like dynegy with a firm like chevrontexaco as partner adds the credibility that enron needs . " dynegy gets to buy " assets on the cheap " that it can tie into its own growth - oriented operations , he said . phelps has never owned enron stock in his funds because he says it ' s too volatile and the company makes it too hard to understand how it generates revenue . bush ties enron ' s chairman and ceo kenneth lay stepped back into the ceo spot following the abrupt departure of jeffrey k . skilling , who left after just six months on the job for " personal reasons . " skilling was called to testify in washington , d . c . , this week , though the sec would not confirm whether it was before their agency . in a conference call with investors wednesday , el paso energy chairman and chief executive william wise said his company would consider buying some of enron ' s assets , though he declined to specify which ones . " we are an asset - oriented company , and we would look at their assets , " wise said . " rather than list any of them for you , you can make your own judgments . " wednesday , a . g . edwards cut its rating on enron to " sell " from " hold , " saying the only reason to own the stock now would be to bet that some company would bid for enron or a large part of its wholesale trading operations . azurix divestiture also thursday , azurix corp . , an affiliate of enron , said it sold its azurix north america and azurix industrial to american water works for $ 141 . 5 million in cash and the assumption of $ 6 . 1 million of debt . azurix is a water and wastewater company . in the third quarter , enron took a $ 1 billion charge , which included $ 287 million for asset impairments at azurix . lisa sanders is a dallas - based reporter for cbs . marketwatch . com .
Subject: broad update on el paso system el paso south system flows 700 mmcf / d less than two weeks after the deadly explosion on el paso natural gas ' system in southeastern new mexico , the pipeline last week had more than 700 mmcf / d of its 1 . 1 bcf / d capacity restored to its south mainline that services markets between texas and california . at mid - day friday , el paso said it began running about 260 mmcf / d through line 1100 after it received the go - ahead from the federal office of pipeline safety ( ops ) , according to spokeswoman kim wallace . el paso was able to re - start partial service on the 26 - inch line after it built a 16 - inch temporary connector line between line 1110 and line 1100 , which was approved by ops . the temporary connector was installed just east of the pecos river explosion site , about 30 miles from carlsbad , nm . wallace said line 1100 would carry the gas from eunice , nm , just northeast of the pecos river compressor station , to the connector with line 1110 , which then would transport it westward across the pecos river bridge where it would meet up with line 1100 further downstream . meanwhile , wallace said el paso submitted to ops last week the test results and a preliminary return - to - service plan for line 1100 . three days prior , the ops had given el paso permission to restore service to line 1110 from the keystone station through the pecos river compressor station at a reduced level . the pipeline re - opened the line at about 400 mmcf / d , and gradually increased it to 480 mmcf / d by friday . this is " still within the limits it [ ops ] set " for line 1110 , wallace said . the ops restricted el paso ' s line 1110 to 80 % of the operating pressure of line 1103 at the time it ruptured , according to department of transportation spokeswoman debbie hinz . she said this put the line at a pressure of about 538 pounds per square inch . the ops - ordered shutdown of line 1110 lasted 10 days , during which the agency ordered el paso to conduct extensive hydrostatic , ultrasound and x - ray tests to determine its safety , and to submit a plan for restoring service to the line . as for the future of ruptured line 1103 , wallace said repairs on it would not begin until after the investigation of the explosion is completed , which will " probably be nine to 12 months . " the restoration of service couldn ' t come soon enough for el paso customers who have been scrambling for transportation capacity ever since federal investigators and regulators closed down the three lines that make up el paso ' s south main leg in the wake of the blast that killed 11 people and critically injured one . california customers have been taking gas out of storage to meet their needs during the service interruption . the department of energy has set up a task force to evaluate the effects of the explosion and shutdown on the gas market . - -

Subject: enrononline documents this email contains the old pa and eta versions . new versions are being drafted . louise , as discussed , there are a few items for which we will need the approval of the new buyer as soon as possible , in order to ensure we are able to proceed with a relaunch of enrononline ( netcoonline ) without delay . two of the items for which we need approval as soon as possible are the password application ( pa ) and electronic trading agreement ( eta ) , which work together to provide electronic trading access to the products available on netcoonline . following is a brief description of the enrononline contractual framework and copies of the proposed eta and pa , which have been revised from the initial enrononline versions to reflect experience of the last two years . contracts structure there are three key documents that create the contractual environment for netcoonline : the ' password application ' ( pa ) , the ' electronic trading agreement ' ( eta ) and the commodity contracts in the form of ' general terms and conditions ' ( gtcs ) ( or , alternatively , a master agreement ) . the pa is the only document which needs a written signature from the customer . the other documents are accepted online . password application ( pa ) the pa is a one - page document and is the only document that has to be physically signed by the counterparty ( as opposed to any of the other documents , which are accepted online by clicking acceptance ) . the pa is the document by which the customer agrees to be bound by the terms of the eta and the gtcs . the pa , signed by an authorized person in the counterparty company , and approved by netco , allows the customer to obtain a master user id . the master user will be able to set up all traders and administrative users within his / her company and administer their access to various products in netcoonline . we will send copies of the pa to likely customers of netcoonline before we launch the site . the document will also be available to be printed from the website after we launch . customers will specify their initial password in the pa and must change it in the first log - in session . upon receipt of signed pa , netco will under normal circumstances enable the master user passwords within 24 hours for pre - approved customers . for counterparties with whom we are not familiar , more time is needed to run credit , legal , contracts , regulatory and tax check . electronic trading agreement ( eta ) the eta binds counterparties to completed transactions through netcoonline . when the counterparty accesses netcoonline for the first time , he / she will be prompted to read and accept the eta in order to proceed . the eta states that all trades done via netcoonline will be governed by the general terms and conditions ( gtcs ) posted online for a particular product , unless there is a master or any other agreement between netco and the counterparty in place . general terms and conditions ( gtc ) when a customer offers to transact in a product type for the first time , he / she will be presented with the relevant gtc . the gtc ' s are similar to a streamlined master agreement , in that they provide the general contractual framework for multiple transactions in a given commodity . gtc ' s identify termination rights , provisions for security ( as appropriate ) , operational conventions ( nominations , etc . ) , payment periods , tax treatments , force majeure , penalties for non - performance , etc . customers must accept the terms of the relevant gtc online in order to proceed with a transaction , unless the company has a master agreement in place with netco . only one acceptance of gtc per product type per company is required . if there is a valid master agreement , then the system will not display the gtc , and the master agreement will apply . password application : electronic trading agreement :

Subject: adaptive trade vince , zimin , i participated in a telephone conference on this company this morning . there was a possibility enron would invest in it . their product appears to be a gui interface over the top of ilog solver ( and possibly ilog cplex ) which allows problems to be expressed in high level terms . i do not see any immediate application at enron , but i am interested in the concepts used so expressed an interest in a demo . maybe it would be useful for general modelling projects here . they do not even have a user manual for their software , so it will be difficult to figure out what it does unless a demo is arranged . the possibility for growth in the company seems small as the ilog software is a modest size market and their product is aimed at only a small part of that market . i think the scheduling tools in sap , i 2 , etc are more likely to succeed than this one as they are already integrated into an information system . because of the small market for this software , the many competitors , the absence of any clear use for it at enron and the early stage of development , there is very little prospect of us funding this company . tom

Subject: fw : california ' s desperate attempts to avoid a rate increase - cera alert fyi - - - - - original message - - - - - from : webmaster @ cera . com @ enron sent : monday , february 05 , 2001 4 : 38 pm to : insights @ cera . com subject : california ' s desperate attempts to avoid a rate increase - cera alert title : california ' s desperate attempts to avoid a rate increase url : http : / / www 20 . cera . com / eprofile ? u = 35 & m = 2241 california  , s desperate attempts to avoid a rate increase on february 1 , 2001 , the california assembly approved and the california governor signed a new law intended to secure power supplies for california . the legislature has been meeting since early january in a  & special extraordinary session  8 to address the power market crisis in the state , and the new law represents their first significant piece of legislation . the bill , ab 1 , establishes a new mechanism for purchasing power for the state  , s businesses and consumers . whether the mechanism works will depend chiefly on whether the limited revenue source used to pay for the power  * collected by the state  , s investor - owned utilities ( ious ) under current retail rates  * will cover wholesale power market costs incurred by the state . the law reflects the obsession by california lawmakers with avoiding a rate increase rather than focusing on the underlying flaws in california  , s market structure . ab 1 ushers in several important changes to the california market structure . it also contains several key provisions that capture the political mood in the state . highlights of the bill include * power buying authority transferred . the responsibility for purchasing power for the customers of california  , s ious has been transferred to the california department of water resources ( cdwr ) . the california utilities will continue to operate and schedule their remaining generating facilities and contracts . the difference between the utilities  , total load and the sum of their resources ( referred to as the utilities  ,  & net short  8 amount ) will be supplied by cdwr , an amount of energy that varies between 5 , 000 and 25 , 000 megawatts ( mw ) , depending on the time of year , time of day , and utility plant availability . the utilities most recently performed this function themselves , buying energy from the california power exchange ( px ) . however , cdwr has been buying electricity on behalf of the ious since mid - january , when the near - bankruptcy of southern california edison ( sce ) and pacific gas & electric ( pg & e ) threatened to disrupt supplies to their customers . cdwr is a state agency that manages water reservoirs and transportation systems in the state . cdwr uses an enormous amount of electricity to transport water across california and provides critical load - shedding capability to the independent system operator ( iso ) . in addition , cdwr  , s reservoirs generate power . the cdwr is thus well integrated in the state  , s electric grid but in the past has not executed large , complicated energy purchase arrangements to supply the customers of california  , s utilities . * portfolio of transactions . the intent of ab 1 is to allow cdwr to execute a portfolio of contracts to stabilize the cost of power for the utilities and their customers . cdwr has until january 2 , 2003 , to execute contracts . cdwr will take title to power and is thereby not just acting as a clearinghouse . it has issued a request for bids and seeks a variety of terms , including monthly , annual , two - year , three - year , and longer . cdwr may also enter into options . thus , although cdwr  , s role is intended to be temporary , the contracts that it executes could extend many years . * power for munis . cdwr may purchase power on behalf of some california municipal utilities at the municipal utilities  , election . * new payment scheme . cdwr will be entitled to a portion of existing utility rates to pay for the cost of purchased power , interest on bonds , and administrative expenses . this payment stream will be equal to the difference between the generation component currently embedded in utility retail rates ( averaging about $ 0 . 07 per kilowatt - hour kwh ) and the utilities  , costs to run their own generation plants , costs of bilateral and qualifying facility contracts , and the costs of ancillary services . the cdwr share of retail rates is referred to as the california purchase adjustment ( cpa ) . it is not clear whether the cpa will cover wholesale power market costs . current prices for multiyear power contracts may lie above the cpa . in addition , if investors believe that the cpa is inadequate to cover costs , the entire program may be abandoned . * new bonds . bonds will be issued to secure power . the total amount of bonds issued may not exceed four times the cpa . the state will transfer $ 500 million from the general fund to jump - start the program , which begins immediately . this seed money and all bond proceeds must be recovered by cdwr from the california utilities  , customers ( and municipal utilities if they opt in ) . * new residential rate freeze . the california public utilities commission ( cpuc ) is prohibited from increasing residential customer rates until it has completed paying all outstanding obligations . this locks in the recent 9 percent residential rate increase indefinitely . governor gray davis thus keeps his pledge not to increase rates further . * retail competition . to help secure a stable payment stream for the new bonds , ab 1 enables the cpuc to prohibit the utilities  , retail customers from choosing an alternative electricity provider until cdwr  , s obligations are paid . although the cpuc has yet to act on this , the action would effectively halt the competitive retail markets in the state for the duration of the cdwr program . * taxpayer protection . ab 1 directs that the new bonds clearly state  & neither the faith and credit nor the taxing power of the state of california is pledged to the payment of the principal of or interest on this bond .  8 thus , the bonds are secured only by the payment stream from utility rates . * no assets affected . the cdwr is granted neither ownership nor control of utility assets . ironically , the authority now granted cdwr is what california utilities had essentially requested last summer when they sought to stabilize electricity prices by executing a portfolio of transactions . the utilities were never provided sufficient authority to execute term contracts . in addition , the utilities have more experience to perform this function than cdwr . rather than aligning retail rates with wholesale electricity prices , california has sidestepped the issue by simply transferring the electricity purchasing function . sce and pg & e are still left to contend with uncollected costs from past energy purchases , although they will no longer incur costs associated with buying power in the current wholesale market while charging frozen retail rates . the utility liquidity crisis has not been resolved . it is not clear whether the law  , s prohibition on rate increases for residential customers can be achieved . the law is silent on rate increases for commercial and industrial customers , providing a potential path for recovering higher - than - expected costs . alternatively , cdwr could conceivably find contracts of sufficient duration and low enough price that the rate pledge is met . these contracts would lock in today  , s retail rates for a long period of time . ab 1 is just one of the steps that state officials hope will restore the power system in california to a more stable footing . key tasks remain . * california  , s wholesale market structure , which helped cause the supply crisis by ensuring that it was not profitable or possible to build generation in california , remains unchanged . the term contracts cdwr is likely to sign will provide a mechanism for mainly existing generators to lay off risk but will not be sufficient to encourage the build of sufficient new facilities . in addition , california  , s siting and permitting process remains largely unchanged . * the state must still address the need to expedite the development of new power plants . * ab 1 does not provide for the recovery of uncollected past wholesale energy costs of california  , s utilities . the state has been negotiating a deal with the utilities that may involve the transfer of generation or transmission assets to the state . however , the utilities have achieved recent court victories that may pave the way to a court - directed recovery of these costs . recent audits indicate that sce and pg & e recovered their stranded costs early in 2000 , which should have triggered an end to their respective rate freezes . a legal showdown between the utilities and the state on this issue may be inevitable . * * end * * follow above url for full report . come shoot the rapids with us at ceraweek 2001 , " shooting the rapids : strategies and risks for the energy future " in houston , february 12 -

Subject: interesting article from motley fool ceo departure puzzles enron investors when enron ' s president and ceo suddenly and unexpectedly announced he was leaving the company earlier this week , the stock got hammered due to the increased uncertainty . the exact reasons for the departure are puzzling and remain a mystery , and this is probably not the last chapter we ' ll hear in this story . by paul larson ( tmf parlay ) august 17 , 2001 the plot around enron ( nyse : ene ) has thickened . on tuesday evening , the commodities market maker ' s president and ceo , jeffrey skilling , said that he was leaving his posts for " personal reasons . " skilling had spent most of his career rising through the ranks at enron and had manned the ceo post since february . many saw skilling as quite brash , sharp , egotistical , and one who brought more than his fair share of youthful energy to the " new - age " enron . but now that skilling has resigned , chairman kenneth lay - - the man skilling took the reins from - - will again act as president and ceo until a permanent replacement is found . lay was enron ' s ceo from 1985 until earlier this year , and he was largely behind the company ' s push to become the wholesale trading powerhouse it is today after years as a sleepy gas line operator . ( for more on the energy industry , see our latest issue of the motley fool select . ) so why did skilling bail ? the first reason skilling cited for his departure was the very vague " personal reasons . " both the company and skilling denied the resignation was for health reasons of any kind , and the secrecy and resultant uncertainty has sent the stock diving , losing roughly $ 6 ( or about 14 % ) of market value on extremely heavy volume in the two trading days since the announcement was made . the move is especially puzzling since the departure is hitting skilling in the pocketbook - - hard . since skilling is leaving voluntarily , he will not receive a severance package that would have reportedly been worth more than $ 20 million in cash and stock had he been forcefully pushed out . even if skilling had been doing a terrible job at enron , one would think he would stick around and wait for the axe to fall instead of leaving on his own , given that potential windfall . the departure is even more riddling when one considers a roughly $ 2 million loan outstanding that enron has to skilling . if skilling had been canned , this loan would have been forgiven . more importantly , if skilling had fulfilled his employment contract to the end of the year - - a mere four more months - - skilling could have kept this $ 2 million free and clear . how many folks do you know who pass up $ 2 million for four months of work ? yet another oddity in this case is the wall street journal ' s report that one of the reasons skilling left was because of enron ' s faltering share price . ironically , the fashion in which he has left has been directly responsible for causing the shares to breach a new annual low . many long - time enron investors may remember when skilling brashly called enron ' s shares undervalued back in january , saying the stock should trade above $ 120 . but since skilling took the helm , the stock has done nothing but fall , losing over half its value in the past six months . even though much of the stock ' s weakness had nothing to do with the company ' s operating performance , the pressure of not living up to that bullish projection was supposedly very difficult for skilling . still , the exact reasons for the sudden departure remain a mystery today . both skilling and the company deny there were any accounting problems or other improprieties behind the resignation , and both continue to speak quite positively about enron . but for a company that has a reputation of strong management , this week ' s activities are highly out of character . investors may be unsatisfied with the current state of affairs and information , but for the time being there ' s little to do but stay tuned .

Subject: associate prc , martin lin dave , you are representing martin lin , an associate currently in the research group , at the mid - year prc . we would like to promote martin to a manager position in the research group , so you will need to nominate him for promotion at the prc meeting for us . martin has spent the last four months supporting ebs . his primary project has been development of a simulation model for analyzing the capability of the media - cast product running on the ebs network . this type of analysis is critical to understanding what types of bottlenecks we might encounter in trying to service , for example , the blockbuster deal . martin has already come up to speed so that he is able to largely replace an expensive contractor from lucent who is under contract to support this modelling effor . prior to supporting ebs , martin used his engineering skills ( b . s . caltech , ph . d . u . of texas in ee ) to create models of regional power transmission networks in order to better understand possible congestion constraints . in our internal pre - ranking meeting we felt that martin was deserving of a rating of superior due to his technical excellence , his excellent attitude and work ethic , and his ability to move projects forward with minimal supervision . regards , stinson

in this way we hope to help the reader to analyse the different models , price a wide range of energy derivatives , or to build a risk management system which uses a consistent modelling framework . ? we believe that for practitioners this last point is very important and we continue to stress in our articles and presentations the dangers of having flawed risk management and giving arbitrage opportunities to your competitors by using ad - hoc and inconsistent models for different instruments and markets ( see also others who propose consistent models ? ) . ? however , it is not our wish to concentrate on one particular model or models , at the exclusion of the others because we believe that the choice should rest with the user ( although it will probably be clear from our discussions the model ( s ) we prefer ) . ? we therefore try and give as clear account as possible of the advantage and disadvantages of all the models so that the reader can make an informed choice as to the models which best suit their needs . ? in order to meet our objectives the book is divided into 11 chapters . ? in chapter 1 we give an overview of the fundamental principals needed to model and price energy derivatives which will underpin the remainder of the book . ? in addition to introducing the techniques that underlie the black - scholes modelling framework we outline the numerical techniques of trinomial trees and monte carlo simulation for derivative pricing , which are used throughout the book . ? in chapter 2 we discuss the analysis of spot energy prices . ? as well as analysing empirical price movements we propose a number of processes that can be used to model the prices . ? we look at the well - know process of geometric brownian motion as well as mean reversion , stochastic volatility and jump processes , discussing each and showing how they can be simulated and their parameters estimated . ? chapter 3 , written by vince kaminski , grant masson and ronnie chahal of enron corp . , discusses volatility estimation in energy commodity markets . ? this chapter builds on the previous one . ? it examines in detail the methods , merits and pitfalls of the volatility estimation process assuming different pricing models introduced in chapter 2 . ? examples from crude , gas , and electricity markets are used to illustrate the technical and interpretative aspects of calculating volatility . ? chapter 4 examines forward curves in the energy markets . ? although such curves are well understood and straight - forward in the most financial markets , the difficulty of storage in many energy markets leads to less well defined curves . ? in this chapter we describe forward price bounds for energy prices and the building of forward curves from market instruments . ? we outline the three main approaches which have been applied to building forward curves in energy markets ; the arbitrage approach , the econometric approach , and deriving analytical values by modelling underlying stochastic factors . ? chapter 5 presents an overview of structures found in the energy derivative markets and discusses their uses . ? examples of products analysed in this chapter include a variety of swaps , caps , floors and collars , as well as energy swaptions , compound options , asian options , barrier options , lookback options , and ladder options . ? chapter 6 investigates single and multi - factor models of the energy spot price and the pricing of some standard energy derivatives . ? closed form solutions for forward prices , forward volatilities , and european option prices both on the spot and forwards are derived and presented for all the models in this chapter including a three factor , stochastic convenience yield and interest rate model . ? chapter 7 shows how the prices of path dependent and american style options can be evaluated for the models in chapter 6 . ? simulation schemes are developed for the evaluation of european style options and applied to a variety of path dependent options . ? in order to price options which incorporate early exercise opportunities , a trinomial tree scheme is developed . ? this tree is built to be consistent with the observed forward curve and can be used to price exotic as well as standard european and american style options . ? chapter 8 describes a methodology for valuing energy options based on modelling the whole of the market observed forward curve . ? the approach results in a multi - factor model that is able to realistically capture the evolution of a wide range of energy forward curves . ? the user defined volatility structures can be of an extremely general form . ? closed - form solutions are developed for pricing standard european options , and efficient monte carlo schemes are presented for pricing exotic options . ? the chapter closes with a discussion of the valuation of american style options . ? chapter 9 focuses on the risk management of energy derivative positions . ? in this chapter we discuss the management of price risk for institutions that trade options or other derivatives and who are then faced with the problem of managing the risk through time . ? we begin with delta hedging a portfolio containing derivatives and look at extensions to gamma hedging  ) illustrating the techniques using both spot and forward curve models . ? the general model presented in chapter 8 is ideally suited to multi - factor hedging of a portfolio of energy derivatives and this is also discussed . ? chapter 10 examines the key risk management concept of value at risk ( var ) applied to portfolios containing energy derivative products . ? after discussing the concept of the measure , we look at how the key inputs ( volatilities , covariances , correlations , etc ) can be estimated . ? we then compare the fours major methodologies for computing var ; delta , delta - gamma , historical simulation and monte - carlo simulation , applying each to the same portfolio of energy options . ? in this chapter we also look at testing the var estimates for various underlying energy market variables . ? finally , in chapter 11 we review modelling approaches to credit risk . ? we look in detail at two quite different approaches , creditmetrics ( j . p . morgan ( 1997 ) ) and creditrisk + ( credit suisse financial products ( 1997 ) ) for which detailed information is publicly available . ? together these provide an extensive set of tools with which to measure credit risk . ? we present numerical examples of applying these techniques to energy derivatives . ? before we begin we stress that the models and methods we present in this book are tools which should be used with the benefit of an understanding of how both the  + tool  , and the market works . ? the techniques we describe are certainly not  & magic wands  8 which can be waved at data and risk management problems to provide instant and perfect solutions . ? to quote from the riskmetrics technical document  &  ( no amount of sophisticated analytics will replace experience and professional judgement in managing risk .  8 . ? however , the right tools , correctly used make the job a lot easier !

Subject: enron japan commercial support model sally i just want to summarize / clarify our discussions so far on the commercial support model for enron japan . my background : in europe the commercial support function was divided into a middle office ( mo ) and a back office ( bo ) part , with a european controller ( fearnley dyson ) responsible for both functions . for scandinavia , the only trading office in europe outside of london , i was responsible for both functions , as local office controller , reporting into barry pearce , who reported to fearnley . in japan i also have this local office controller function , as being responsible for mo / bo activities in this region . the mo would consist of the trading related functions : documentation ( capture & confirmation ) , risk management , settlement and trade accounting . the bo would consist of g & a ' s , salaries & wages , tax , management reporting , statutory reporting and vat . back office : i report directly to cassandra scultz ( vp & cao of enron apachi ) . as much as possible are to be outsourced to our sydney office ( heidi mason , who also reports to cassandra ) , but some work has to be done in tokyo . the reasons for this outsourcing decision is enclosed in the power point presentation enclosed below . for payments we use houston treasury , as they are the only ones that can exercise a payment in the banking systems . middle office : mandate what i have in writing is a section from joe hirl ' s memo ( request for japan power trading positions ( draft ) ) to rick buy and greg whalley dated april 19 this year ( please find enclosed ) back office operations : jan erland bekeng in cooperation with sally beck will look to establish the local risk books in tokyo and define any system modifications necessary given the characteristics of the japanese electricity market . enron japan will handle trade capture and risk management while confirmations and settlements will occur in houston under sally beck  , s supervision . it support and system modification will be overseen by anthony dayao and performed in houston . discussion - current & future situation i see more commodities than power . metals will arrive september 25 , weather is on the way from sydney , and garry hickerson will from september 1 have a guy here doing irfx , agri and maybe equity . we are also looking into oil deals , and have plans for gas , coal , pulp & paper , credit and emissions . also ebs is on the way . i only see metals , irfx and weather as active desks this year , maybe oil . power will take some more time to get active , due to the very closed market situation here right now . on the origination side we might see some structures / cross commidity / finance deals go through . thus we have a mix of activites from enron apachi , enron global markets , ebs and enron metals . basically everyone wants to do some business in japan . to coordinate all these activities we need to build the most cost efficient , independent , segregated , automised and service minded japanese commercial support function possible . to accomplish these objectives , outsourcing to sydney is an alternative that has been discussed extensive lately , and is highly recommended from our side . labour costs in sydney is 25 % of the costs in tokyo . due to sydney ' s experience and size they are ready to expand and take on this project . they already have the segregation and independence in place , and would give us an extra layer of segregation in the sense of being an intermideary between tokyo and houston . bilingual staff would be hired to perform japanese services , which is widely available in sydney . and there is only one hour in difference between us . outsourcing these activities from japan to australia is a growing trend , and many large corporations have done it this way . there will be some time from the first trades until functions and commodities are moved to sydney . tokyo want and needs to learn , understand all details , automise , make routines and calibrate systems first . on the confirmation side our legal department would be heavily involved in th start , compared to later stages . proposed mo structure for enron japan a ) responsibility for all commercial support activities in japan to be sourced to enron japan , under enron japan ' s cfo . b ) outsource programmable tasks to sydney : - documentation ( capture & confirmation ) - settlement - trade accounting c ) risk management in tokyo . i look forward to hear from you . regards jan - erland

Subject: california update 4 / 27 / 01 the following report contains confidential and sensitive information . please treat with discretion . executive summary : ? ferc price cap decision reflects bush political and economic objectives . politically , bush is determined to let the crisis blame fall on davis ; from an economic perspective , he is unwilling to create disincentives for new power generation ? davis finds four major flaws with ferc plan , most notably its exclusion of out - of - state generators ? june lst " kill clause " for ferc order could coincide with new bush regional plan ? california facing growing fiscal risk following bond downgrade , expected $ 20 billion power bill this summer - - economic crisis would force deeper administration involvement ? qf bid for advance payments from pg & e likely to fail in bankruptcy court ? new generation delays probable because of state / qf squabbling ? consumer groups are preparing a constitutional challenge to socal bailout deal 1 . ferc fallout the ferc decision is a holding move by the bush administration that looks like action , but is not . rather , it allows the situation in california to continue to develop virtually unabated . the political strategy appears to allow the situation to deteriorate to the point where davis cannot escape shouldering the blame . once they are politically inoculated , the administration can begin to look at regional solutions . moreover , the administration has already made explicit ( and will certainly restate in the forthcoming cheney commission report ) its opposition to stronger price caps on the grounds that they are unwilling to create disincentives to the construction of new generation . it is interesting and ironic to note that electricity generators were generally happy with the ferc order and that the only ferc commissioner who favors price caps actually voted against this plan . 2 . something less than effective price caps from davis ' s point of view , the ferc plan has four major flaws : ? the order applies only to california , not to the rest of the west . non - california generators are not required to sell at capped rates to california . ? as the order is written , it is more of a price floor for emergency power than a ceiling . ? state officials also believe that energy suppliers will continue to game the system , because the price mitigation scheme only kicks in after a stage 2 emergency and does not require any collusion . ? even when the price caps kick in , they are based on the cost - plus for the highest cost producer supplying power to california and do not require wholesalers to abide by the cap . the generators can also charge above the cap , provided they can subsequently justify the excess charge to ferc . 3 . proposal " kill clause " adds to the political dilemma for davis the ferc proposal includes a " kill clause " that says the caps will be withdrawn unless california ' s iso agrees by june lst to become part of the regional grid now under ferc control . if davis doesn ' t sign on to the regional grid by june lst , then he will have to live with june 2 nd headlines blaming him for letting the " bush price caps plan " collapse . 4 . growing fiscal risk in california sources speculate that california could therefore pay as much as $ 20 billion on power this summer - this is more than the combined enterprise value of pg & e and sce . these sources believe that , because of the severity of the situation , the ferc and / or the federal government will be forced to take further action to control prices for power . the consensus is that the state of california will run out of money in about 90 days . one of the first projects to be cancelled will be state plans to finance new power plant construction in exchange for long - term power deals . the bleak fiscal picture is also causing bank creditors to revisit the bridge loans they are providing to california . the bush administration and the fed are only now waking up to the seriousness of the fiscal picture . the country ' s largest and most prosperous state will have gone from large surpluses to serious debt downgrades and devastating deficits in a matter of months . 5 . qfs to seek advance payment from pg & e meanwhile , on the bankruptcy front , the qfs reportedly will ask the bankruptcy judge today to give them advance payment from pge ' s accounts , since their natural gas vendors have likewise demanded advance payment for gas . it appears very unlikely that the qfs ' request will be granted . if the qfs do not receive advance payment , it is likely that most of the 4 , 000 mw of gas - fired qf capacity will remain offline . 6 delays likely in new qf generation the qf deals made with the state for long - term contracts are being continually renegotiated , which is likely to mean that the new plants those contracts are supposed to finance will not be online as early as anticipated . 7 . consumer groups ready to challenge constitutionality of sce bailout plan harvey rosenfield and his colleagues reportedly have been reviewing an analysis of the mou for the sce bailout plan . the analysis was done by a utilities analyst , rather than a lawyer , though it appears to raise a number of good legal points . for example , one of the elements of the mou is a " non - bypassable " charge on ratepayers that would require them to pay even if they disconnect from the grid . this is effectively a tax , since there is no exchange of value for money , which under the ca constitution cannot be used to directly benefit a private entity . this makes the bonds that would be issued are general obligation bonds , rather than revenue bonds . according to the constitution , the state cannot be put into debt to benefit a private company . for this and other reasons , even if the republicans would vote for the sce bailout , which remains unlikely , the bailout probably would not stand a likely constitutional challenge . 8 . governor hurt by continued failure to disclose long - term power contracts the issue of the governor ' s failure to disclose the details of the long - term power contracts continues to distress the other players in the crisis . even if he were to disclose everything he and his staff have been negotiating , it is likely that their actions and negotiations will challenged , creating an even further delay .

Subject: re : thomas knudsen steve , i shall talk to anjam about it . our impression here in houston is that thomas is quite qualified and we are very interested in him . a few days will not make much difference in the hiring process . vince steven leppard 04 / 17 / 2000 03 : 50 am to : dale surbey / lon / ect @ ect , vince j kaminski / hou / ect @ ect cc : subject : thomas knudsen dale , vince as you all know i have attempted to get thomas knudsen interviewed as a result of prof lane hughston ' s recommendation ( lane is an acquaintance of vince and me , and is a very senior figure in the world of quant finance ) . anjam vetoed the idea of interviewing thomas since he was " too old and too experienced " . since i felt that thomas has some merit , i asked houston to have an informal chat with thomas . houston wish to pursue the interview process further , and anjam has set about setting up the interviews . i ' m somewhat concerned about the way in which anjam is going about this , since it seems he ' s trying to put up barriers to these interviews . i received a concerned email from thomas knudsen this morning in which he recounts some strange conversations with anjam . he says he received a call from anjam on thursday ( 13 th april ) evening ( outside office hours ) , asking how he got his cv into enron ( i ' d shown anjam the email and cv back in early february ) , and how anjam could contact him ( despite the fact he was contacting him at that moment ) . anjam then called thomas on his work number ( bad form ) on friday 14 th asking thomas to come in for interviews on monday ( one working day ' s notice ) . thomas told anjam he was going on holiday on wednesday of this week , and that he ' d have to see if he could make time given the need to tidy up some things at work . he said he ' d contact anjam on monday ( today ) to confirm his availability . today ( 17 th april ) thomas called anjam to say he couldn ' t make it , and that he wouldn ' t be able to make it for two weeks ( not so serious , he thought , given that we ' re losing time to easter anyway ) . anjam told thomas that the position might be filled in two weeks ' time . thomas is concerned about missing the boat , and i for one didn ' t even realise it was leaving so soon ! can anyone shed any light on this ? steve
Subject: california update 8 / 20 / 01 executive summary ? legislators prepare to address socal bailout options ? $ 5 . 7 b revenue notes request in state treasurer ' s hands bonds & bankruptcy : the edison mou is expected to be the major issue on the political agenda this week , and the legislative leadership wants to pass some bail - out measure by this friday ( 8 / 24 ) . while analysts are confident that there will be an mou passed , many are skeptical that the current proposals will be able to cobble together 41 votes in the assembly . the davis administration has said proceeds from the november bond sale will be used to repay the $ 6 . 2 b borrowed from general fund to purchase energy . however , repeated delays in the bond sale have caused concern . and pg & e is upset that the money will be first used to pay off the state without offsetting some of the funds the state owes pg & e . assembly republican leader dave cox has said that his members will not vote for any plan that is not a clean bailout ( i . e . without additional provisions related to environmental mitigation ) . thus , he is essentially saying his members will vote for assembly member rod wright ' s proposal , and no other current plan . but wright ' s proposal does not have much support from democrats . sources report that at least one prominent legislator , senator mike machado , has apparently remarked that he is not certain of the need to pass an mou . others may be muttering similar things , but an mou is still likely . strangely , though , no discussions were held at the staff level this week on mou legislation . the key driver in the mou debate is how much of a " haircut " sce will be required to take ( as a hit to the parent company ) . sources report that sce will accept a haircut of $ 500 m . however , should the haircut be placed in the range of $ 1 b , we are told that sce ' s bryson has informed his team that he would take sce into bankruptcy voluntarily . this represents a significant turnaround in sce ' s previous optimism , which is attributable to legislative indifference to the sce bankruptcy threat as well as growing tension between bryson and governor davis . as for the middle range between $ 500 m and $ 1 b , it is difficult to ascertain how high sce will go before pulling the bankruptcy trigger . short term - anticipatory notes state controller kathleen connell has asked for an emergency sale of a $ 5 . 7 b short term note ( possibly in the form of a revenue anticipation note / ran ) to cover california ' s electricity costs until november , when $ 12 . 4 b in state bonds are expected to be issue by the legislature . the state controller ' s request was made because of her legal obligation to issue a demand to the treasurer at any time she determines that the general fund has or will have insufficient funds for the payment of all appropriations by the legislature . connell claims the ran , which could be offered as early as september , is necessary because the state ' s general fund is running dry from recent power purchases . state treasurer angelides is studying the plan , but has yet to publicly comment . according to sources , he has also yet to comment to legislators , but was in new york last week meeting with people on wall street about the bond issuance . mandated by state statute , angelides can issue these notes unilaterally and does not need approval from the legislature or anyone else . he has total discretion on the issuance , its timing , and its amount . however , the state ' s general fund would not be depleted by november 15 th , even without the ran revenue . rans are not that unusual . rans were previously issued from fy 95 - 96 through fy 99 - 00 with the largest being the $ 5 b ran in fy 92 - 93 . because of california ' s recent economic growth , rans were not necessary last year and were expected to be unnecessary this year . concerns surrounding the pg & e suit filed earlier last week ( pg & e seeks priority in the $ 12 b revenue bond allocations ) are somewhat eased by a well - placed utility source who report that the suit will have little impact the revenue bond or anticipatory notes ' issuance . however , there is suspicion among some that the administration is increasingly concerned that investor confidence is weakening and that the bond issuance might be deemed a failure , and is thus promoting the idea that pg & e ' s actions are responsible , rather than investor uncertainty over revenue stream allocation and dwr contracts . in the event that the revenue bonds ' issuance is delayed past the october 31 st bridge loan maturity , the interest rate charged to the state would reportedly jump from four percent to seven percent .

Subject: pending refund order discussed at today ' s commission meeting although a final order is not yet available , we were able to glean the basic content of the commission ' s latest refund order from the discussion had at the commission meeting this morning . it appears that the commission has not strayed far from judge wagner ' s recommendations , which came out of the settlement conference ordered by ferc . highlights include : in california , refunds / offsets apply only to spot transactions in caiso and calpx , and only as of october 2 . both public and non - public utilities are subject to refund . it appears that the refund methodology will be similar to that of the june 19 order , as refined by judge wagner . daily spot gas prices will be utilized in the methodology . a 10 % creditworthiness premium will be added . an evidentiary hearing will be ordered to collect the data needed for the methodology ; it is our understanding that the caiso will have 15 days to provide certain information and the judge must certify the record in 45 days . a separate preliminary evidentiary hearing will be ordered to consider pacific northwest refunds . it was briefly described as consisting of an information gathering proceeding of 15 days , followed by an evidentiary proceeding of 30 days . the judge would then have an additional 7 days to report to the commission . an issue will be the definition of " spot " transaction for the pac nw , since counsel to the commission noted that it could differ from the spot definition for california . we are awaiting the final order and will update this report as soon as it issues . ra

Subject: re : sale of red rock expansion capacity a couple of more things on red rock . first , shelley asked whether ena participated in the open season . if not , and if they are interested , or if mavrix or any one else who didn ' t participate in the open season is interested , we ought to put something on the ebb that says " tw is now accepting binding proposals for the capacity described in its _ _ _ _ , _ _ 2000 open season and any shippers that didn ' t participate in that open season but who are interested in capacity should contact a tw marketing rep . " or something like that . is there any problem with that ? second , the jeffs ( fawcett and dasovich ) and perhaps others will be talking to danny shortly about a possible next phase expansion into california . someone please take point on passing info from that meeting on to shelley and mkm and me . shelley may want to have stan tell madden that we are looking at an additonal large expansion beyond the one we are about to file . the pr mileage might be useful but shelley will need to know as much as we can disclose outside about what we are up to . if we get serious about looking at something that goes beyond the cal border we may want to hold that internally for a while and not tell madden . on the other hand , i don ' t have any problem with stan telling madden that we have general concerns about whether pipe expansions within california will keep pace with interstate expansions to the border . jeff d ' s analogy of the " four lane superhighway turning into a dirt road " is too good not to use with madden ! df susan scott 02 / 15 / 2001 05 : 33 pm to : mary kay miller / et & s / enron @ enron , keith petersen / et & s / enron , drew fossum @ enron , sstojic @ gbmdc . com , fkelly @ gbmdc . com cc : maria pavlou / et & s / enron , lee huber / et bid accordingly - bids will be evaluated based on highest rate . - minimum term is 5 years . - if there are tie bids that all qualify as highest rate and quantities bid upon exceed quantity available , the tie bids will be allocated pro rata . - shippers should indicate whether they would be willing to have their bid capacity prorated in case an allocation is necessary . - bids should include : 1 ) service request and 2 ) offer letter stating material terms ( rate , term , points , quantity ) . offer is binding . it can include a regulatory " out , " but cannot be " subject to management approval . " the only shippers that will be contacted are those that responded to the nov . open season in a timely fashion . ( drew , i found out this includes calpine ) . explanation : the commercial group decided ( pending steve harris ' s approval ) that they prefer the " highest rate with a minimum stated term " over highest net present value because it is consistent with stan ' s stated preference for " front loading " the contracts . in other words , a shipper that bids $ 0 . 60 for 5 years beats a shipper that bids $ 0 . 35 for 15 years because it has bid the highest rate . questions ? comments ? please reply soon . our marketers want to contact shippers tomorrow . competing pipelines are already out soliciting bids for their expansions . . .

Subject: california update 7 / 25 / 01 p . 3 details are still rough and the situation is very fluid , but here is what is currently going on : senators hertzberg and keeley are amending both sb 78 xx and ab 82 xx . upon an initial read , it appears that they are doing the following : ab 82 xx has been gutted except for the direct access provisions and the renewables portfolio . ( the core / non - core business provisions , the transmission asset purchase , etc . all appear to have been deleted . ) both of these provisions that have been left in the bill were seen as positive by members last week when the bill was first debated . it appears amendments have been made to sb 78 xx but the extent of these changes are not yet known . at the beginning of both amended bills , it states , " as proposed to be amended into sb _ xx . " this means that amendments to sb 78 could be incorporated into ab 82 , and vice versa . another possibility is an entirely new bill .
Subject: 2002 operational costs i understand what you are looking for , and bob hall and i look forward to sitting down with you to review operations costs for enron americas . i do think it will be meaningful to you to look at the components of the aggregate number to understand all of the functions that are provided and the drivers behind the cost structure for each function . they are different . some costs are impacted by number of transactions , some are not . for instance , all operating companies are allocated a portion of the cost of producing the dpr each day and posting results on the executive reports viewer . regardless of the number of transactions , there is a fixed cost for aggregating that information . that fixed cost estimated for the year likely will not change . what may change is the allocation methodology used - - i . e . if eel adds four new product lines to be aggregated on the dpr and if it is a very manually intensive task to get that information daily , then we may adjust the allocations such that eel ' s percentage of the total cost of producing the dpr will be appropriately increased . for the past two years , we have created the operations budget for enron americas with a defined set of services as the underlying assumption in the budgets . there have been times when we have had to add personnel to handle new businesses that have been created that were unknown during the budget process ( ex : wellhead desk ) or deals that are done that are very operationally intensive ( ex : asset management deals ) . when this happens , we calculate the fully - loaded cost of the person or persons required to support that new activity and have the commercial person responsible for that business sign off on the additional expense to be incurred that was not in the original operations budget - a change order to the original budget . i know that wes is coordinating the budget review meetings for enron americas , so i will work with him to make that happen . in addition , greg piper and i are trying to get a time that works for you and john lavorato early next week so that we can discuss the mechanics of a service level agreement . - - sally - - - - - original message - - - - - from : kitchen , louise sent : thursday , september 6 , 2001 2 : 01 pm to : beck , sally subject : thanks for your voicemail - just to clarify though i am not looking for an aggregate number - i am looking for a number per transaction which we can contract at between ea and enw . thanks
Subject: p & l tom , we attached both a consolidated p & l and an updated prudency schedule . the weater hedge made $ 165 , 000 today . the only odd thing that we saw was the physical change due to deal changes with the hplc operational desk . this desk is a desk that is set up to account for fuel , gas loss , and physical ua 4 , we have tickets out there with zero volumes on them that get updated after the month is over once volume management knows where the gas needs to be allocated . what we found out that happened was that in the last week of february and in the first week of march sitara added volumes to these tickets before were were running comparison reports to see the changes . darren noticed the incorrect volumes on these tickets and had logistics zero them out . darren thought that the changes would have no position effect as if it were a deal between hplc and texas , but it is actuall as if we changed a deal that we did with another region . the value was offset by changes in tufco and storage . we released $ 270 , 000 out of march prudency to keep you flat for the day . hope you had fun at the school function . i ' ll be here until about 8 : 30 , so feel free to call if you get this . bryan

Subject: organization announcement enron purchases billions of dollars of products through its wholly owned subsidiaries and venture companies worldwide . historically , the company has conducted these purchases in a highly fragmented , decentralized manner allowing each of the operating units the discretion to source their requirements in a manner that optimizes unit performance . today , however , with the implementation of sap and the profound explosion in internet / intranet - based technologies , we believe the company should change its direction and focus on aggregating its demand for goods and strategically sourcing these requirements on a global basis . we believe that there are significant cash savings to be extracted by the company and also commercial potential for the formation of a highly profitable , business - to - business e - commerce venture . effective february 1 , 2000 , enron will form a new global strategic sourcing unit . this new unit will consolidate the current successful strategic sourcing initiatives underway in the gas pipeline group , global asset operations and enron corp . initially , global strategic sourcing will focus on aggregating enron  , s internal , joint venture and business partner demand for products and services with the objective of creating a future business - to - business e - commerce venture . it gives us great pleasure to announce that george wasaff , managing director , will lead this new global initiative . george will report directly to mike mcconnell , chief executive officer for global technology . george has been with enron for fourteen years and has held many senior executive positions , the most recent of which was managing director of enron south america ' s wholesale operations . george was also the interim chief executive officer of elektro from july 1998 through june 1999 and chief executive officer of transportadora de gas del sur s . a . ( " tgs " ) from june 1995 through february 1998 . george has also held numerous commercial positions including vice president and country manager , mexico for enron international and vice president of marketing for transwestern pipeline company . please join us in supporting this new global initiative and congratulating george in his new role with the company .

Subject: re : the objective seems to have gotten alittle lost here . we want the terms to be firm and as specific as the version we had on friday ( although i take point about arbitration and vesting of rest stock - although we have to insert something in here ) . bear in mind umbrella had agreed to these terms and mark m and lance were to run them passed top gun . presuming they did , seems to me it is reasonable to assume this is what the deal will actualy be ( lance also mentioned creditor committee had seen umbrella ' s term sheet last week ) . the covering memo should be explicit in asking the ee to confirm that if a deal was presented in substantially these terms , they would sign them . the wording needs to be tight and regardless of it ' s enforceability make above clear . in other words let ' s make it look as binding as we can . if we really can ' t do above let ' s say so and we can look at plan b . john , it may be best we can achieve here is an indicative draft which we talk with top 20 about and tee them up for real thing circa jan 10 . however let ' s wait and see if we can get one more draft done for weds . david - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - sent from my blackberry wireless handheld ( www . blackberry . net )

Subject: commoditylogic financial invoice exchange vl . 0 the fix module vl . 0 is now operational and meets all the specifications as shown in the frs . the team would be happy to show you a demo at your convenience , perhaps early next week . we anticipate our back office using fix in parallel with existing systems for december 2000 , and then using fix " under fire " for january 2001 invoices . the demo uses actual data from sempra , our largest volume natgas financial counterparty . in about a minute , fix is able to compare enron data and sempra data ( received electronically as an excel spreadsheet and stored on a mini version of our deal database ) , immediately matching about 1450 of the 1500 deals . it then helps the user to manually match those 50 deals that the primary match engine could not . this whole process , if it were purely manual , would take more than a day . using excel spreadsheets ( and sort functions ) , enron currently spends 4 to 8 hours per month matching sempra invoices . fix allows the user to perform all matching in about 10 minutes . our next deliverable is the confirm central module vl . 0 , due 1 december . we anticipate delivering it on time , as we have with fix . all the best , tom

Subject: re : clayton vernon i have some concerns regarding vernon being able to transfer even if he is temporarily successful with deliverables defined for him . according to enron policy , an employee can only transfer if he is in satisfactory standing or better . this is to prevent problem employees being moved from one organization to the another . this sounds like a " work ethic " issue to me and the chances that it would continue in another department are great even if he is temporarily successful . but if kevin presto knows the situation and he still wants vernon in the end , i will push for an exception as this satisfies our obligation to be forthright . please keep me informed of clayton ' s progress as time goes on so we do not get criticized for passing on a problem employee . thanks . sheila vince j kaminski 07 / 28 / 2000 08 : 35 am to : kevin m presto / hou / ect @ ect cc : vince j kaminski / hou / ect @ ect , sheila walton / hou / ect @ ect , vasant shanbhogue / hou / ect @ ect subject : clayton vernon kevin , vasant and i talked to clayton about his request for transfer . clayton received a conditional approval contingent upon completion of the current project he works on . vasant will formulate exact definition of the deliverables and we will hold clayton to it . if he fails to deliver the request for transfer will be rejected . anything else would be highly demoralizing to everybody . clayton has so far produced exactly zero ( no single output was delivered ) though he was advertising the projects inside and outside the group as completed . i want you to be aware of it , because i have serious doubts regarding clayton ' s integrity . vince

Subject: virginia power pnr michelle , from our earlier conversation , this is what probably happened to virginia ' s intended injection of 4 , 793 at the panhandle pool pnr point for 12 / 14 / 01 on pnr contract 27719 : virginia had already discussed this type of transaction , meter bounce at nng - gray with burlington , since amy mulligan and chris miller worked with greg and hillary to inject gas back into the park n ride point for 12 / 11 after their initial withdrawal on 12 / 10 . amy informed the customer on how to nominate transaction type 31 to create a " bounce " on the tw side of the station . they miscalculated the fuel usage and had to do a second bounce on 12 / 12 to balance their contract at that date . virginia again withdrew gas on their park n ride on 12 / 13 with the intention to inject the gas on 12 / 14 . the problem appears to be that burlington did their nomination for the timely cycle , but virginia did not get their information into our system until 3 : 00 pm which tagged it as an evening cycle nom . chris miller confirmed burlington down to zero for the timely cycle since virginia ' s contract did not appear on this cycle . i do not know how chris knew about this particular gas day ' s transaction . the tw late shift person did not know ( or forgot ) about the meter bounce so the two transactions did not get confirmed on the evening cycle . the scheduling system will not display any meter bounce information unless you specifically request the point and the meter bounce filter . our usual procedure to review unconfirmed nominations is to select a blank / null point and the " shipper nom " filter . it appears that meter bounces will not appear under this scenario . our system will also not show meter bounces by selecting a blank / null point and the " meter bounce " filter . our system does not have an " all noms " filter . since meter bounces are relatively rare in our system , shippers are strongly encouraged to contact us when they submit a meter bounce nomination ; otherwise , we do not look for them in the system . i am working with terry kowalke to make meter bounces more visible to us , but no one here is aware of any conversations with either burlington or virginia power regarding the meter bounce for 12 / 14 or any later date . please let me know if i can supply any further information . thanks , bert

" the la paloma plant site is approximately 40 miles west of bakersfield , calif . in western kern county on an industrial site previously used for oil production . when completed , it will be the state  , s largest facility designed from the ground up exclusively as a merchant power plant . a merchant plant sells its electrical output to wholesale customers in a regional competitive bulk power market . those wholesale customers , which include traditional utilities , municipal utility districts , retail energy services companies , wholesale power marketers , and electric cooperatives , in turn arrange to have the electricity delivered to retail consumers . the la paloma development team has selected abb alstom power inc . as the turnkey contractor for the project . abb alstom power is responsible for the design and engineering work , the procurement of equipment and management of sub - contractors , and the actual construction of the facility . the la paloma generating project received its california energy commission approval in october 1999 , and the financing package for the project is being completed now . " the rigorous permitting process really laid the ground for an outstanding construction program , " said roger garratt , project development manager for pg & e corporation  , s generating unit . " we look forward to making a major contribution to the kern county economy in a manner that is completely compatible with the area ' s sensitive ecosystem .

Subject: fw : getting a deal done - - - - - original message - - - - - from : belden , tim sent : thursday , december 20 , 2001 3 : 27 pm to : lavorato , john ; whalley , greg subject : getting a deal done i recognize that we are in a very fluid process right now . however , i feel that i currently don ' t possess the information that i would need to make a decision about what structure and compensation would work for me and people on my team in newco . i will attemp to lay out the issues that concern me and provide thoughts on what i have heard about structures so far . excuse me if i am off on any ( or all ) of my facts . i am currently receiving mostly second - hand information from gas and power traders in houston . here is the citibank deal as i understand it : requirement to retain between 5 and 15 employees to do the deal . fund ( at some unknown level ) a retention pool to be distributed in some unknown manner to an unknown subset of the 800 newco people . 800 employees $ 30 million of 1 - day 95 % var total 2002 costs of approximately $ 300 million . bonus pool equals 20 % of ebit bonus paid out 75 % in cash and 25 % in restricted stock with a 3 - year cliff vest . here are my concerns the cost structure appears to be well above what a $ 30 million var trading operation can support . my recollection from west power rovar is roughly 90 % in 1998 , 120 % in 1999 , and close to 200 % in 2000 and 2001 . i ' m not sure how to handicap expected future rovar , but without additional information from the two of you i have a hard time expecting more than 100 % in a lower - priced commodity market . given that assumption , the $ 30 million one - day var becomes $ 480 million annualized var gives you gross margin of $ 480 million . i don ' t know what the capital and credit charges will be , for arguments sake let ' s call it $ 30 million . bonus pool equals $ 480 - $ 30 - $ 300 = $ 150 * 20 % = $ 30 million of which $ 22 . 5 is cash and $ 7 . 5 equity . i can ' t sign up for that math . please help me understand how / why my math is wrong . i need to understand our cost structure in great detail . we need to figure out a way to allocate costs to the desk level . if i look at west power ( everyone in portland ) assume that we have 80 people with an average of $ 200 , 000 for base salary and benefits giving us total personnel costs of $ 16 million . add on another $ 4 million for rent , parking , travel and entertainment . . . and call it $ 20 million of direct expenses here . i figure that we can make $ 100 million in 2002 with lower var and starting up later in the year . how much of the $ 280 million remaining costs should i expect to be allocated to the west power desk . with an ebit of $ 80 million times 20 % i can sell . if we have another $ 50 million of allocated costs then i can sell this . i recognize that the potential buyer is unlikely to fund a desk by desk ebit . however , i think that our goal should be to split the pie based on a desk by desk ebit and would like to see a proforma that accomplishes that . proposed retention structure for three people in portland a dollar amount paid in cash over one year and equity over two years . price tag tbd . create certainty around the bonus / retention payments . indemnify against payback of deferred comp . clarify total retention dollars for the rest of the desk . 15 % of gross margin for 2002 . 20 % of ebit going forward . other gripes labor has not been invited to the negotiating table . labor doesn ' t get to see the pro forma . we are supposed to get paid based on ebit yet i have no control over the expense side or the allocation side . labor is getting accused of holding up a deal that labor had no part in negotiating . labor is the most important driver of the value of this deal and doesn ' t appear to have any rights other than to accept or reject a poorly defined structure . i want to make this thing work . i am not trying to be greedy . i am finding it very difficult to navigate through this process given the very limited information that i have been given . tim

( note that this is 3 days after their authority expires ) ferc will release its proposed order on 11 / 1 / 2000 based on the results of its 206 investigation of the california wholesale power markets . we don ' t know what they will find or what they will propose . the proposed order will have a 30 day comment period , after which ferc will likely issue a final order . ferc will be accepting oral comments on 11 / 9 / 2000 in washington . enron still has to determine who will provide oral comments . many companies have filed at ferc advocating or opposing a litany of price caps , cost based rates , and market redesign recommendations . it is likely that the price caps approved by the iso board will go into effect . how long they will remain in effect will depend on whether ferc extends the iso price cap authority and whether the final order stemming from the current 206 investigation stipulates a specific price cap policy . impact of price caps the attached spreadsheet contains a table of likely maximum monthly prices at different gas price levels . we think that this is the highest that markets would clear since it assumes that each hour clears at the cap . it is hard to say whether actual prices would clear significantly lower than the cap because we don ' t know whether sellers will offer below the cap or at the cap . the assumptions behind our analysis are detailed in the bullets below . take actual historical loads from 1999 and 2000 . calculate implied price cap for each hour using actual historical load , new price cap methodology , and a range of gas prices . divide historical hours into peak and off - peak buckets . calculate average price for each month for peak hours and off - peak hours . for example , we have two years worth of data for the months of january through september . each month has approximately 400 hours . for january through september , we took approximately 800 observations for each month ( 400 from each year ) and calculated a simple average of all of the individual observations . we created a peak table and an off - peak table . the table shows the calculated implied cap based off of the acutal loads at varying gas prices for each month . this value represents what the month would clear at if each hour cleared at the cap ( based on historic loads ) . while any given hour could be above this value , our calculation estimates the likely monthly average cap value ! the blue shading indicates what the caps would be given current ( 10 / 27 / 2000 nymex ) forward prices . the yellow shading indicates those forward power prices which are in excess of the proposed cap .
Subject: one - part vs two - part flag on tw contracts the following contracts were truly negotiated as one - part rates ( inclusive of reservation , commodity and surcharges ) : k # 24194 pnm $ 0 . 1100 / dth k # 24568 enervest $ 0 . 2200 / dth k # 24654 ena $ 0 . 2175 / dth the way the invoice system is designed , all contracts identified as one - part automatically generate ' credits for commodity ' on the reservation invoice . however , this causes us to underbill the shippers because these rates bump up against the max tariff demand rate . in the past , we switched the flag to be two - part to minimize the amount of manual invoice corrections for the schedulers . because we are briefing contracts and beginning our data conversion review / process for the new ets contracts system , we will correctly reflect the contract as negotiated . therefore , effective with september 2001 invoices , schedulers must remember to delete the credits for commodity on these invoices . also , the marketers will need to ensure the input of any discounts ( commodity and / or demand gri surcharges ) , if necessary , to guarantee that tw does not overbill these shippers . bottom line , make sure that the total amount invoiced on the reservation and commodity invoices combined for these contracts = rate listed above * contract maxdtq * number of days in month if you have any questions about this process , please contact me . thanks , elizabeth

mentioned in our hpl staff meeting we are investigating the merits of entering into a joint venture or another transaction structure that will position hpl to effectively compete in the texas intrastate market . our primary objective is to gain access to additional sources of gas supply and achieve the required economies of scale to compete with other intrastate pipelines . i would appreciate your confidence and support in developing the optimal course of action for hpl and for enron . the skills that we have developed in our group are critical to growing our upstream origination business in n . america , as well as to the ongoing operation of hpl . our origination strategy is to leverage our business operations , field operations , engineering , producer services , and marketing skills to capture value from transportation , gathering , storage and commodity opportunities on the gas / power grids . we need our current employees to accomplish this objective across n . america . we have proven our ability to add value to enron by developing the powder / wind river pipelines , installing electric compressors , contracting for processing capacity , and establishing a new gas supply corridor along the gulf coast . our recent efforts to provide services such as business operations , measurement , trading / marketing , and accounting services to third party producers and pipelines also looks to be a promising growth opportunity . it is very important to our ongoing business relationships and our competitive position in the market place that we do not discuss hpl related matters with third parties . please come see me if you have any specific questions or concerns . also please refer any third party inquiries regarding hpl to tim determing .

Subject: revised - bullets 7 / 7 usgt sold 20 , 000 mmbtu / d of daily firm space moving gas for the weekend from pg & e topock to socal needles at $ . 10 / mmbtu . this was somewhat of a novel deal in that the california price spreads opened up and gas became trapped at pg & e . once our station 4 compressor becomes fully operational , this opportunity will likely dry up . enron n . a . representatives contacted us this week to discuss our possible participation in a gas storage field using a depleted reservoir on navajo land near farmington , nm . third party developers approached ena looking for assistance in moving the project forward . new tariff services marketing consensus was reached to delay any further development of transwestern ' s hourly firm service until the potential markets of power plant loads become operational . during this interim period , park ' n ride services provided on an intra - day basis shall be priced incrementally higher than park ' n ride services provided on a timely basis . any resulting market response will provide indications of market willingness to pay premium transport rates for hourly transportation service . el paso el paso merchant services needs to re - scrub their verbal offer to transwestern of a $ 15 million lump sum " pre - payment " option of fuel monetization for their combined 65 , 000 mmbtu / d of san juan to california capacity . el paso did not take into consideration the different termination dates of the two contracts ( 25 , 000 mmbtu / d pg & e permanent release contract , and 40 , 000 mmbtu / d gallup expansion contract ) in their analysis . a revised proposed lump sum payment offer is expected mid - next week . el paso field services met with ep representatives to discuss a possible interconnect near wt - 1 . the i / c would be sized for 40 , 000 mmbtu / d . ep proposes to pay for and set compression to flow this gas into our high pressure line and has agreed to a volume commitment of 20 , 000 mmbtu / d for up to 2 years . an added advantage is most of the volume would come from the constrained atoka area which would allow agave to increase deliveries to tw . caithness corp . caithness has decided to move forward on their 1000 mw generation project in northwest arizona . the 2 - phase project would initially consume 80 , 000 mmbtu / d of gas . the proposed location is 40 miles south of tw ' s line near wickieup , az . we are meeting with caithness reps next week . projected in - service date for the plant is early 2002 . wt - 2 cooler expansion level b cost estimates are being prepared . revenue / cost savings assumptions predict $ 500 , 000 annual revenue to support the expenditure . once installed , the project would give tw an additional 50 , 000 mmbtu / d capacity on the east end . financial evaluations will be done once the cost estimate is received . ngpl winkler interconnect ngpl notified us this week the reactivated point should be operationally ready to flow gas on july 17 ( about 2 weeks ahead of schedule ) . this will hopefully provide new system supply to tw ' s east end of about 80 - 90 , 000 / mmbtu / d .

Subject: special assets - - enron executive services for several months we have been working on an idea to exploit the staff and experience we have in special assets to develop a fee - for - service " executive services " business . the key idea is to participate in potentially rewarding companies and projects without commitment of enron ' s investment capital . i believe that this would be a logical extension in applying the skills and management approach we already are taking with our own portfolio . as part of some initial feasibility evaluations , we recently have had discussions with bill gartland , a houston entrepreneur , with extensive contacts with national and provincial governmental development agencies in spain . gartland is seeking management and financial expertise to promote industrial , commercial and real estate projects in spain . among other things , he presently lacks the professional skills to evaluate and package projects for presentation to sophisticated capital providers in the united states and europe . in addition to checking personal and business references , we had rick carson ' s group perform a due diligence review of mr . gartland . his background and reputation are clean . through gartland ' s contacts we have been invited to meet with representatives with the sociedad estatal de participaciones indrustriales ( sepi ) , the spanish state - owned holding company for business development . in addition , we will meet with representatives of instituto de fomento ( info ) , the regional government of murcia ' s business development group . info has agreed to fund all of our incountry expenses while in murcia on this initial visit . in order to take advantage of this opportunity we have accelerated our plans to test the market for the types of services we envisage providing and are scheduled to meet with sepi , info and other contacts in spain the week of june 11 th . unfortunately , with the tight schedule we could not arrange a general meeting to cover the concept of enron executive services ( enronexec ) . however , we have prepared an informal presentation as a briefing prior to next week ' s trip . i would stress the following points : these initial meetings are informational and relationship focused . no commitments will be made next week . one of the key principles of enronexec is that we are not a source of capital . among the services we offer will be analysis of capital needs and preparation of business and / or project plans for presentation to capital providers . activities contemplated for enronexec will complement the normal workload of special assets . there will be no reduction in our efforts to achieve our primary business objectives for the team . the expenses to evaluate the potential and , if viable , to startup the activity are modest and are consistent with our approved 2001 expense plan . our eventual objective to fund enronexec is to structure cash fees at least sufficient to cover staff time and out - of - pocket costs . we will look to acquire significant equity participation that would offer the attractive potential value upside . as a byproduct benefit through contacts with various businesses , we may identify new synergies and opportunities for other enron businesses . i am very enthusiastic on enronexec . it appears that it may be a way to leverage enron ' s unique resources and strengths into a profitable enterprise that does not require separate capital . i would appreciate your comments and questions .

Subject: california update 09 . 03 . 01 - - debate over direct access heats up this story reflects fairly well the debate underway regarding the da suspension date . the treasurer , angelides , is taking a hard line . we are working with others to get the date pushed back . california puc staff has started calling around trying to estimate how many customers have very recently switched or are trying to . they have made inquiries to our customers , including uc / csu . best , jeff state fights 6 , 000 firms ' energy deals discount power contracts deemed unfair to consumers bernadette tansey , chronicle staff writer sunday , september 2 , 2001 ? 2001 san francisco chronicle url : thousands of california businesses may reap cost breaks on electricity while other utility customers live with record rate hikes if the state lets stand a spurt of last - minute contracts with private power suppliers . more than 6 , 000 firms , including big retail chains and industrial plants , signed discounted power contracts in july and august as market prices dropped . state officials are incensed , saying the private " direct access " contracts with electricity providers could shift the burden for millions of dollars in state power purchases onto households and small businesses . state treasurer phil angelides said the same companies that benefited as the state depleted its budget surplus to keep the lights on now want to escape paying their share of the billions spent to ensure power supplies for california . " i think it ' s wrong and it ' s immoral , " angelides said . state officials argue that the summer contracts can still be canceled retroactively because california businesses were on notice that their option to shop around for better deals on electricity was about to be suspended by the state public utilities commission . the puc is set to consider the retroactive ban thursday . but energy firms say the summer deals were perfectly legal because the puc had not yet taken action and made a series of draft decisions that put off the effective date of the direct access ban until as late as yesterday . " the drafts were not consistent , " said tracy fairchild , a spokeswoman for alliance for retail energy markets , a consortium of generators and energy suppliers . " which one were we supposed to take seriously ? " the energy trade group is threatening to sue to protect the summer contracts . angelides fears that a prolonged court fight could block a $ 12 . 5 billion state bond sale to reimburse the treasury for california ' s emergency power purchases . the burgeoning conflict is part of a continuing fight by energy firms and some of their business customers to preserve direct access - - a core provision of the state ' s 1996 deregulation law . deregulation supporters predicted energy consumers would enjoy lower prices if private generators were allowed to compete with the utilities as power suppliers . but the direct access program was thrown into disarray last year when wholesale electricity prices skyrocketed and the state stepped in to buy power . to make sure the state ' s outlay would be paid back by all ratepayers , the legislature in january directed the puc to suspend direct access . by that time , most direct access customers were fleeing back to the utilities to benefit from a rate cap that protected them from the soaring market power prices . the puc postponed action on the direct access ban while some legislators were sponsoring bills that would have allowed the program to continue under certain conditions . but by july , market prices had come down , and energy providers like enron energy services , aes new energy and strategic energy were again offering direct access contracts . businesses were looking for relief from the record rate hikes imposed on utility customers in june , said phoenix energy consultant gina coleman . coleman said she helped five retail chains with " a significant number " of stores in california negotiate contracts with strategic energy this summer . " business is business , and if you can get a better price for something , you should , " said coleman , who declined to name her clients . she said the lower costs will help the stores keep doing business in california and hold their prices down . daniel douglass , an attorney for the alliance for retail energy markets , said any attempt by the state to cancel contracts retroactively would violate the constitutional law . he said energy firms have purchased power to serve their customers under the contracts and would suffer losses if they were canceled . angelides said the same firms that ran to the state for protection when their market contracts became too expensive now want to take advantage of lower power prices he attributes to the stabilizing effect of the state ' s long - term power contracts . " you can ' t take advantage of the state ' s stabilizing the rates , then say , ' thank you very much , ' and stick everyone else with the bill , " angelides said . state officials have not tallied the total number of customers who signed up in july and august , nor have they estimated the revenue loss that would have to be covered by remaining utility ratepayers . figures compiled by the puc show that commercial and industrial firms signed more than 6 , 000 new direct access contracts in july alone . a rough calculation suggests that , as a result , the firms might contribute as much as $ 64 million less annually to the repayment of state costs . the loss might not be significant enough to risk a court fight that would delay the bond sale , state officials said . bu angelides said the same power firms that helped create the energy crisis by charging exorbitant rates are now threatening a bond issue desperately needed to restore funds needed for education , health care and children ' s services . " what they ' re talking about doing , " he said , " is holding us hostage until they get what they want .

' s g / l ) . according to gas acct . , they will calculate ua for each of the profit centers ( 19 in total ) . as we discussed , vm does not have the appropriate unify reports or manpower to support this level of accounting at this time and for this month will continue to tie ua 4 out as we have in the past using our same reports - gas acct . will have to sum their side of the ua 4 calc . to match us . with the foresight of eventually going to profit center level accouting and reporting , there will need to be significant changes to our current back end systems and processes to handle this lower level of reporting . i believe the flash is already being done at the different profit centers , but all the downstream groups are still performing their analysis at a more consolidated level . there were discussions in the meeting that oa would not go to this lower level , but i am of the opinion that we all need to be consistent in our analysis and reporting across the organization - so if this is the path we take , then everyone ' s process will need to be able to handle this level of detail . of course , no decisions were made in our meeting , and as i stated , for now , vm ' s process will remain unchanged for this month . please let me know if you want to discuss further . thanks !

" enron has consistently said that it believes its dealings with the fastow - related partnerships were proper and properly disclosed . the company has said it put billions of dollars of assets and stock into partnership - related transactions as a way to hedge against fluctuating market conditions . the sec inquiry came from the agency ' s fort worth , texas , regional office . according to a person familiar with the matter , this would indicate that the inquiry comes from the sec ' s enforcement arm , as opposed to its corporate - finance section . the participation of the enforcement branch would indicate that the agency is looking into whether there were possible violations of securities law . however , enforcement - branch inquiries often don ' t produce any allegations of wrongdoing . it also appears that the sec hasn ' t yet taken the step of launching a formal investigation , which would be a sign that the agency believes securities laws might have been violated . the sec declined to comment . certainly , there have been questions and concerns about those partnership transactions , which contributed to a $ 1 . 2 billion reduction in shareholder equity last week as part of enron ' s efforts to unwind the deals . mr . fastow , who has declined repeated interview requests , resigned from the partnerships , known as ljm cayman lp and ljm 2 co - investment lp , in late july in the face of rising conflict - of - interest concerns by wall street analysts and major company investors . since then , internal partnership documents have shown that mr . fastow and perhaps a handful of enron associates made millions of dollars last year in fees and capital increases as general partner of the ljm 2 , the larger of the two partnerships . mr . fastow ' s partnership arrangement caused some unhappiness inside enron , according to people familiar with the matter . for instance , these people say , sometime after the creation of the partnerships in 1999 , enron treasurer jeffrey mcmahon went to company president jeffrey skilling and complained about potential conflicts of interest posed by mr . fastow ' s activities . mr . skilling didn ' t share mr . mcmahon ' s concern , these people say , and mr . mcmahon requested and received reassignment to another post . mr . skilling resigned as enron president and chief executive in mid - august , citing personal reasons and the fall in enron ' s stock price , which peaked at about $ 90 a share last year . mr . mcmahon and mr . skilling haven ' t responded to repeated interview requests . investors are also concerned about potential problems arising in enron ' s dealings with other related entities . in some cases , enron could be required to issue large amounts of stock to noteholders in some of the entities if certain so - called double trigger provisions occur . for example , last july enron helped create the marlin water trust ii , which sold $ 915 million in notes that are due july 15 , 2003 . however , enron can be considered in default , in advance of that date , if its stock price falls below $ 34 . 13 for three trading days and its senior debt is downgraded to below investment grade by either moody ' s investors service or standard & poor ' s . currently , enron debt is still investment - grade at both ratings agencies and would have to be lowered by several notches to fall into a noninvestment grade category . last week , moody ' s put enron on review for a possible downgrade . however , observers believe that even if moody ' s lowers enron ' s rating , the company will still be investment - grade . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . october 23 , 2001 where did the value go at enron ? by floyd norris new york times what really went on in some of the most opaque transactions with insiders ever seen ? wall street has been puzzling over that since enron ( news / quote senior columnist thestreet . com 10 / 22 / 2001 07 : 15 am edt url : enron is trying to improve disclosure to investors , but its decision to reduce equity by $ 1 . 2 billion in the third quarter has created dismay and confusion in the market . the action was disclosed in a dubiously discreet manner . more important , investors are struggling to pinpoint how the shrinkage will affect enron ' s balance sheet , profits and earnings guidance . enron didn ' t provide answers to questions submitted on the equity reduction . enron doesn ' t include a balance sheet in its earnings release , so the equity decrease couldn ' t be spotted in numbers supplied tuesday . and even though enron did break out $ 1 billion in earnings charges in its release , the company didn ' t feel it necessary to mention the equity write down anywhere in the text . instead , the public first heard about it on a tuesday conference call . ceo kenneth lay said enron had shrunk its equity as a result of terminating a so - called " structured finance arrangement . " the wall street journal later reported that enron ' s counter - party in this transaction was an investment partnership called ljm 2 co - investment , which has set up and run by enron ' s finance chief , andrew fastow . this is what lay said on the tuesday call about the equity move : " in connection with the early termination , shareholders ' equity will be reduced approximately $ 1 . 2 billion , with a corresponding significant reduction in the number of diluted shares outstanding . " according to the journal , lay then said wednesday on another call that enron had repurchased 55 million shares . enron ' s supporters count lay ' s mention of a reduction in the share count as bullish , because it should boost earnings per share numbers in the future . but there are two possible problems with this theory . first , enron affirmed its previous earnings guidance that it expects to make $ 2 . 15 per share in operating earnings next year . critically , the company did not say whether its guidance was given using a share count without the 55 million shares or not . if the forecast does assume the exclusion of the 55 million shares , the company should have upped its 2002 per - share earnings forecast by around 6 % , since that ' s the amount by which the share count will be reduced . enron needs to say what share count it ' s using in its guidance . second , it ' s almost impossible to determine where these shares were ever recorded , casting a certain amount of doubt on lay ' s assertion that the share count will come down . why question the ceo ? well , in its 2000 annual report , enron included some disclosure of the 55 million shares connected with ljm 2 . it reads : " at december 31 , 2000 , enron had derivative instruments . . . on 54 . 8 million shares of enron common stock . " the derivative instruments appear to be types of options , or agreements that give the counterparty the right to buy or sell stock at agreed prices . but these derivatives - linked shares don ' t show up where they should in the annual report : in the table that breaks out the difference between the basic and diluted share counts . the line item in this table that shows options - related shares totals only 43 million shares , which is close to the amount of employee pay options that qualified for inclusion . therefore , that number almost certainly doesn ' t include the 55 million ljm 2 - related shares . the fact is , at least some of the 55 million derivatives - linked shares should be included if the derivatives were like normal options . that ' s because the ljm 2 derivatives appear to have been " in the money " , or profitable for the holders . typically , all in - the - money options - based stock has to be included in the diluted share count . and these ljm 2 derivatives did appear to have that status at the end of 2000 . back then , enron stock was trading around $ 80 , way above the average $ 68 level at which these derivatives made money for ljm 2 . maybe these weren ' t simple options and had other conditions attached that excluded them from the diluted share count . that ' s what disclosure elsewhere in the annual report appears to imply . alternatively , the options were embedded somewhere else in the share count table or equity disclosure , though it ' s hard think where . presumably , investors will get a full explanation in enron ' s quarterly financial results filing with the securities and exchange commission , due by the middle of november .

Subject: travel services while recent events have dramatically impacted enron ' s travel volume , alliance worldwide ( formerly travel agency in the park ) wanted to contact you regarding the enron travel program . since 1984 , our company has been a strategic business partner with enron and has provided a complete scope of services from booking , ticketing , ticket delivery , customer service , reporting , management of clicktrip , to facilitating preferred vendor arrangements with airlines to benefit enron . these services have been provided on a management fee basis from alliance to enron . as of december 1 , 2001 the management fee has been suspended during enron ' s period of reorganization . we are continuing to provide the turnkey travel services to enron and forego the management fee and simply charge a time of ticketing fee per ticket . to provide you with a brief history of our arrangement , enron and alliance approached the airlines a couple years ago and negotiated deep upfront discounts for enron ' s business travel . these discounts are available only through alliance and are given at time of ticketing . all commissions were stripped from the price of the discounted ticket and returned to enron , in exchange for enron paying alliance a contracted management fee . this management fee was paid monthly and allocated back to each enron cost center based on the total number of transactions . this travel program provided enron over $ 8 . 6 million in airline savings on $ 55 million spent in the year 2000 and over $ 5 . 2 million on $ 33 million spent for the first 3 quarters of 2001 . these savings are after the payment of the travel agency management fee . the effect that the reduced travel volume will have on discounts provided by the airlines cannot yet be determined . we have contacted the airline companies and most of enron ' s preferred carriers have agreed to extend the contracts through april 2002 . you may utilize these discounts through alliance by calling 713 650 - 8080 or 1 800 962 - 0248 . in march , enron and alliance will begin evaluating enron ' s volume and travel patterns , and determine any changes that are to be made to the discounts or fee structure . as mentioned earlier , alliance is implementing a time of ticketing fee in lieu of a management fee . these fees are reimbursable to enron employees through normal expense report procedures . specifically , the new fee structure is based on zero - commission contracts for tickets purchased from enron ' s preferred carriers . the fee schedule for all airline tickets for enron travel is as follows : $ 30 - domestic tickets with or without upfront discount $ 30 - international tickets without upfront discount 25 % of savings , capped at $ 175 - international tickets with upfront discount $ 15 - southwest airlines and clicktrip reservations , hotel / car only bookings the savings to enron on a per ticket basis more than covers the nominal fees that are charged . for example , enron ' s average ticket prices are $ 589 domestic and $ 2207 international ( after discounts ) . enron ' s average savings are $ 144 domestic and $ 587 international ( before fees ) . the savings are more than three times the per ticket fee ! if you are accustomed to booking your own travel online , you may continue to do so by booking through clicktrip . clicktrip is the only online booking tool that allows access to enron ' s negotiated discounts . ticketing through clicktrip also bears a smaller fee of $ 15 if no agent assistance is necessary . there is no charge to look at schedules . clicktrip is available 24 hours a day and may be accessed through enron ' s intranet site or via the internet site . clicktrip is also a useful tool for checking flight schedules or for checking upgrade status . to check upgrade status or to review a ticketed itinerary , simply click the check my trip button on the clicktrip home page and fill in your name and amadeus locator number ( provided at the top of your itinerary ) . a user log - in may be obtained by contacting alliance at 713 328 - 5100 . if your office location , phone number or any profile information has changed , please notify us by return email . a profile form is attached if you prefer to fax the information to alliance at 713 328 - 5600 or if you are a new traveler wishing to set up a profile . we at alliance are proud of our 17 year association with enron and dedicated to ensuring you of the best possible service at the most economical price for all of your travel needs . we have a highly trained and experienced staff working on enron ' s account and we look forward to providing you with continued service for years to come . if you have any questions regarding any of the changes mentioned , or wish to discuss specific details relating to your corporate travel policies , please call me 713 328 - 5139 , or email lhinson @ allianceworldwide . com . sincerely , lee ann hinson director account management 713 328 - 5139 lhinson @ allianceworldwide . com >

Subject: your help needed please - cross - commodity reporting please excuse the long e - mail below - i knew we ' d never get a chance to all get together , and this is somewhat urgent as i have to complete the finance committee presentation for the upcoming bod meeting by the end of next week , and it will include trading results for the lst quarter , reported in accordance with the risk management policy . due to issues noted below , this may require immediate attention by your staff as we have a few short days to come up with the best quality numbers we can . i talked to beth already , and mrm met with chris abel ' s group to see if there was a short cut , but our joint conclusion was that the business unit controllers need to be involved in this process as you are the experts on your businesses and can apply the best judgment to decide on the trading results to be reported to the bod . we ' ll probably need to go with our best estimate of 3 / 30 # s as of end of the day next tuesday or wednesday at the latest . as you recall , the february 12 th bod meeting resulted in a clarification that the bod approved trading limits were limits on the generic commodity groups defined , and accordingly the trading results must be reported consistent with that limit structure ( management reporting can be different of course ) . chris abel ' s global energy operations group has prepared a " rac " dpr that attempts to aggregate the commodity groups in accordance with the risk management policy , so that top management and the bod can see enron ' s exposure to individual commodities on a consolidated basis . ( a ) this dpr will not impact actual sharing of p / l from a management reporting / business unit perspective - this is purely for market risk management purposes and reporting to the bod . but commercial management will need to review and sign off on the rac dpr and monitor limits accordingly , as these limits are at an enron level . the specific trading results we need for the bod presentation are the first quarter p / l and average daily var , by commodity group . the first rac dpr available is as of 3 / 30 - so while it has cumulative p / l , var is only as of 3 / 30 . ( note - we ' re also comparing to lq 2000 , but we ' re not going to attempt to resolve cross - commodity reporting for that period except at a high level ) . your participation is needed in resolving : 1 ) cross - commodity reporting per the new rac dpr - both retroactively for the lst quarter , and going forward , and 2 ) rovar ( return on average daily var by commodity group ) for the lst quarter . this aggregation of cross - commodity activity has been completed by chris as of 3 / 30 , so he has what he believes to be p / l aggregated for the quarter in accordance with the policy . what we don ' t have is var on a daily basis as the first time it was calculated on an aggregated basis was on 3 / 30 . obviously we ' re not going to be able to go back and calculate daily var for the entire quarter by commodity group aggregated in this new manner - especially within a week . so it appears we ' ll need to " swag " average daily var - by reviewing the cross commodity positions aggregated at 3 / 30 , by considering cross - commodity activity you ' re aware of that took place throughout the quarter , and using our best estimate of the impact on var for this cross commodity activity . due to this adjustment in historical reporting practices , we feel a certain level of due diligence is required for us to feel confident we ' re reporting to the bod in accordance with the policy . and since we only have a few days , i thought a team approach to tackling the review would facilitate a prompt resolution of material issues , and then you and chris ' group can work out your processes and procedures on how to handle going forward as you see fit . when you consider materiality , please involve your market risk contact - while a transaction / position / book may not be material to gas or power , it may be material to global products , weather , etc . . would you please help us with the following : ? confirm your review of chris ' aggregation on the rac dpr at 3 / 30 ( chris ' staff can walk you through ) ? are all the cross - commodity positions you ' re aware of being reported correctly ? ? is there other cross - commodity activity not present at 3 / 30 and consequently not aggregated for the quarter ' s results , but actually present during the first quarter and material ? if so , estimate impact on p / l and average daily var . ? we ' re not expecting an exhaustive search or analysis - perhaps you can simply discuss this issue with the traders who handle this type of activity to get a feel , and if they point on specific material transactions , we can address those ; you can determine best approach ? are there certain books in risktrac that have cross - commodity positions imbedded / combined - either held currently or those that generated significant var or p / l during the quarter ? going forward these will need to be reported separately to facilitate risk reporting , but in the next week what we need is an estimate of the impact on the corresponding commodities , or a conclusion that the impact is immaterial . ? once you ' ve reviewed the summary of cross commodity activity per the rac dpr and per your own knowledge , help us estimate the impact on the respective commodities ' average daily var for the quarter - you can discuss with your market risk contact your recommendation on a reasonable " swag " approach . after considering the information above , please provide your assessment on whether you are in fact able to capture and report all the cross - commodity activity , and if not , identify the issues involved and whether it is something that market risk needs to address , or if it will simply take more time to resolve the reporting details . if you have other recommendations on how to get comfortable with the trading results for the quarter , please feel free to pursue those . i do not mean to imply i know how to do your jobs , or that you ' re not doing them - i simply want to coordinate with you to ensure the # s we report to the bod are the numbers you agree with , and that if they ' re not completely accurate given recent implementation , that we are able to articulate and estimate the potential misstatement , if any . as you are the experts on your businesses ' results , i simply wanted to make sure i closed the loop with what we in mrm understand regarding your reporting of the cross - commodity activity and trading results and the application of the policy . on a separate note , we need you to identify p / l related to special transactions that flowed through the dpr , but do not really represent trading activity - examples in the past are sfas 125 transactions and other unique gain / loss events - we ' re reporting lq 2001 and lq 2000 , so whatever we can recall about last year will also be considered . we will be sending you a reconciliation from the dpr to the bod package that we use to document any special adjustments , and will discuss this with you to come to an agreement on adjustments to the dpr reporting to derive true trading activity . these adjustments should be minimal , but we ' d like your input to conclude . thank you for your cooperation , regards , cassandra schultz x 30429 713 858 2618 cell 936 321 2185 home ( a ) for example , north american electricity limits represent enron ' s consolidated na electricity trading activity , without regard to which business unit or commodity group actually executes the trades or holds positions . so if power has some gas positions for hedges or other reasons , these gas trades need to be removed from power var and p / l and combined with gas ' var and p / l , etc . . heating oil positions held outside global products should be aggregated with global products ; global products ' positions in gas and power should be aggregated with gas and power , with corresponding adjustment to global products ' results .

Subject: california update 8 / 28 / 2001 please feel free to address any california or western power questions / comments to g . britt whitman at ex : 54014 or kristin walsh at ex : 39510 . executive summary ? legislative maneuvering towards a bail - out plan mou developments the assembly energy costs and availability committee held hearings yesterday on the socal bailout plan , ab 82 . the chairman of the committee , rod wright , has agreed with hertzberg and davis to move something out of the committee , possibly by mid - week . much of the assembly ' s efforts to move along a comprehensive plan have been encumbered by the introduction of over 50 amendments . additionally , demonstrations by a group of farmers and resort owners opposing the conservation easement provision included in the bill may also slow the process . three central valley democrats ( reyes , flores and canciamilla ) on the assembly committee on energy costs and availability will likely be paying close attention to the demonstrations against the conservation easements , as farmers are significant in their districts . all three legislators face reelection . reyes has already signaled that , even though she voted for the bailout last time , she is disinclining to do so again . these three democrats may impede the progress of the bailout . there are strong indications that the plan will not come to a vote until it has the necessary votes to pass . at this point there still appears to be a lack of consensus on the democratic side . another substantive amendment to the current plan has been a call by socal for " fair market value " of its transmission assets , rather than book value . this value , of course , would have to be estimated and essentially means that even more money would have to go toward the bailout . while committee chairman wright would not oppose this idea , it will likely be hard for many of his colleagues to swallow , particularly on the senate side . once the amendments are disposed of and the bailout plan clears the assembly energy costs and availability committee , it will then go to assembly appropriations . the chair of this committee , carol migden , is friendly with both hertzberg and governor davis , so the plan appears unlikely to receive significant opposition in her committee . it will then go to the assembly floor for a vote . since it is likely some sort of bailout plan will pass the assembly , it likely will fall to the senate to decide ultimately if a socal bailout makes it to the governor or not . therefore , it becomes important to examine what deals might be made between burton and davis in order to get a bailout through the senate . for example , burton wants a change in the workers ' compensation laws to increase payouts to workers . this is a very important issue . on the one hand , both trial lawyers and the unions support burton . on the other hand , he is strongly opposed by the powerful ctma , the republicans and pro - business democrats , including governor davis . in fact , davis has already vetoed this legislation at least once and has promised to do so again . it is conceivable , though unlikely , that a deal could be struck whereby burton would allow a socal bailout to pass in exchange for davis signing workers ' compensation reform . however , if this were to happen , both the bailout and the workers ' comp reform together would be an enormous burden on california businesses at a time when these businesses are not doing well . this is why a deal on this particular topic appears unlikely at this time .

Subject: re : regrouping of enw budget discussions wes and team had preset the meeting schedule and topics to be covered in each . the outline that i sent you with the changes for the remainder of this week is simply our best attempt at fitting coordinating topics around people availability and the meeting schedule that had already been set . the schedule that we have been working with that wes provided did not allocate two hours for the friday meeting . if you had set aside two hours , that had not been communicated to us . there were only two one - hour meeting slots on that schedule . one for enw from 1 - 2 and one for research from 3 - 4 . i have a major conflict on friday - i committed months ago to attend a meeting that ken lay asked to be involved in that is in the woodlands that runs through the evening hours . . only because beth perlman is out on thursday for a religious holiday , i decided to " skip out " from this meeting to be here on friday afternoon to discuss the operations and it development budgets together . in order to minimize my time away from the woodlands meeting , i orchestrated the time swap with vince kaminiski so that we could have our enw meeting at 3 : 00 . i will talk with you later today and fill you in on the commitment for ken lay . maybe we can work together for a scheduling solution that works for both of us . i would appreciate your help on that , louise . scheduling issues aside , wes suggested that we also review with you the ees budget that enw has prepared . our approach so far has been to determine the appropriate and necessary spend for 2002 for expense and capital for all of the services that enw provides to support the ees business . we have done this without regard to who will cover which expenses - ees or ea . that is a separate issue from understanding the services that need to be provided and our best estimate at costs . we are prepared , however , with a suggested split on the costs for discussion purposes . i have assumed that the decision on cost sharing or allocation would be made between the offices of the chair for ees and enw . if you would like to cover all of enw ' s budgets together , both for ees and ea , then it would make more sense to set a longer block of time ( maybe 3 hours ? ) . i will bring my schedule to our meeting at 11 : 00 today to cover the canadian budget and we can work out a schedule that works for both of us . we will be prepared to discuss pricing per transaction , but will hold that until the end of our meetings when we have been able to review with you the components of costs and the detail of capital projects . our review of costs and projects in effect will serve as our " scope of engagement " discussion . a service provider would never quote a firm price until agreement had been reached on the scope of the engagement . we will have a straw man for discussion on that . - - sally - - - - - original message - - - - - from : kitchen , louise sent : wednesday , september 26 , 2001 8 : 23 am to : beck , sally cc : piper , greg ; pickering , mark ; colwell , wes ; killen , faith ; roper , kerry ; schoppe , tammie ; valdez , christina subject : re : regrouping of enw budget discussions i am expecting an all in cost for this service - what do we achieve in separation . i had allocated two hours on friday to do this from lpm until 3 pm . are you not intending an all in cost ( per transaction ) of it and operations ?

Subject: independent variables for ene regressions brad , as we discussed , it ' s very difficult to find drivers of the ene stock ' s behaviours . we investigated about 30 comparable stocks , 10 capital market indices , and three energy commodity indices . regular regressions as well as regressions with different legs and leads were performed . some variables show significant correlated with ene stock during particular time periods , but most of those correlation disappears when we tested them over different or longer time periods . only two variables , s & p utility index ( spxu ) and dow jones utility index ( util ) , show stable and significant relationship with ene stock ( a summary of these relationship can be found in the attached file " outputsummary " ) . but as you can see , the r 2 are below 30 % . also , the ? durbin - watson statistics tell us to be careful about autocorrelation . ? basically , the regression analysis so far confirms our original opinion - - ? it ' s hard , if not impossible , to find out any real driver of the ene stock . ? after enron added new core business several month ago , the stock behaved more ? or less like a tele _ comm stock , which suggests that enron stock has entered ? into a new phase . to capture , at least trying to capture , its ? characteristics in the new phase , we need a lit bit more time to cumulate the ? market date . ? ? let me know if you need me investigate more variables or you come up with ? some new thoughts . ? ? ? ? vincent ? ?

( the net effect of this will be zero because the slight increase / mmbtu which will show up on the monthly transportation invoice will be negated by the corresponding credit for the pre - paid transportation . ) please call me to discuss . thanks . lorraine

Subject: juvenile diabetes foundation fundraising it is my sincere honor to once again lead the enron team in this year ' s juvenile diabetes foundation ( jdf ) walk scheduled to take place on sunday , november 5 , 2000 , at the sam houston race park . i continue to serve on the board of jdf representing enron and will be enron ' s corporate executive for this year ' s fundraising efforts . as many of you may already know , i am an insulin dependent diabetic myself . even though i know how difficult this disease can be to manage with the multiple finger pricks for blood samples and several shots each day , i cannot imagine how difficult it is for a small child with this disease . taking insulin does not cure the disease nor prevent the development of complications ; insulin is simply their life support system and without it they would die . enron continues to be a major corporate sponsor for jdf again this year . jdf is a very efficient organization in which approximately 84 % of all money raised goes directly to research . enron ' s goal this year is to raise $ 225 , 000 and we need your help . enron has been the number 1 walk team for 5 years in a row and we are not ready to give up first place ! we need team leaders , walkers and volunteers to help us reach our goal . the theme for the walk this year is " knock out diabetes " and we would like to have you join us for this great event . the walk is truly a blast and we had about 500 enron people participate last year and everyone enjoyed it . if you are interested in volunteering to be a walker or a team leader , or if you would like to make a pledge , you may call any of the steering committee members listed below . if you are interested in being a team leader , please contact one of the following people immediately so that you may be included in the first important and informative training session taking place this week . thank you very much for your support . mike mcconnell steering committee members : blanca bollom x 66091 rachel feldt x 57629 deb gebhardt x 39606 cathy phillips x 36898 john walt x 35379 debbie yates x 35305

users , rights , books , global data - is completed and tested on a per application basis . some code changes may still be in process but integration testing can begin to ensure the applications still talk to each other . 3 ) integration test planning focus will be to run representative transactions from eol to sap through all core trading applications to ensure that applications and interfaces still work . we will not be testing functional permutations , data conditions , validation or exceptions to any significant degree . 4 ) each application conversion team must test their changes before approving their changes for integration testing . we are operating from the premise that data , infrastructure and code changes have been tested at a application system level before the enterprise integration test starts . 4 ) all systems will be physically split ( even unify at this point ) . 5 ) integration test team will develop and execute the test plan for both estate and new co . 6 ) we will integrate key business reps into the process for planning and execution and they will have shared responsibility for signoff on the test to support go live to production . 7 ) we will minimize the differentiation between new co and estate for conversion and test team purposes . there are two teams - conversion and integration test . each team will focus on both estate and new co . resources are too tight and the process is too inefficient to separate responsibility . 8 ) estate conversions must happen at the application level before new co conversion work can begin in earnest . estate conversion is on the critical path for new co . key issues 1 ) we will push to get a decision to see if we can focus on financial trading first , then physical . if financial is the focus , delivery risk goes down dramatically . for now , we must plan on the worst case - - physical and financial on jan 20 . 2 ) we need both a dev and a test environment for all systems that support aep and bridgeline in estate . this means that we need a dev environment ( and hw gap addressed ) for unify , sitara , cpr , tagg / erms . conversion teams need to coordinate with infrastructure immediately on this issue to make sure we ' re in synch . 3 ) unify servers probably can ' t be owned by new co while running a single license of unify . 4 ) some systems are using ' short name ' instead of duns id as a key for counterparties from global . the global , tagg / erms , unify and sap reps must quickly define the best approach for making global data changes and minimizing hard coded reference id risks . 5 ) we must clearly define limits of conversion and test scope to hit these potential dates . we must focus on core systems with only core changes required to support day one trading . 6 ) we can only convert estate over the weekend due to aep / bridgeline considerations . the time window will be very small . core conversion team 1 ) steve stock -

Subject: re : trip to london next week sally thanks for the note . i will look forward to seeing you hear next week and meeting with you in person for at least an hour or so . john enron capital & trade resources corp . from : sally beck 14 / 03 / 2000 15 : 58 to : john sherriff / lon / ect @ ect cc : subject : trip to london next week brent price and i will be in the london office next week , arriving monday morning and returning to houston on friday . the purpose of my visit is in regard to my global risk management operations role , i believe that rick causey met with you regarding some operations support that brent and i will provide to fernley during a transition period prior to the arrival and during the assimilation of michael jordan , the jp morgan staffer that fernley has hired . brent and i will be working with fernley next week to iron out the details of our support for fernley during that transition period . we will also map out an enron trading operations introduction for michael jordan , which may involve a short stint for him in houston . my goal is to provide a strong resource to fernley during this transition period and to work with fernley to provide whatever assistance , training , and orientation to michael in his role so that his assimilation can be as smooth and effective as possible . another purpose for the trip is to spend some time with fernley and his business controllers to get their ideas on specific goals that as a group we would commit to for 2000 . i know that barry and richard sage have many good ideas on how we can leverage knowledge and best practices across all enron locations with trading operations . my earlier trips to london this year were focused solely on helsinki , and did not allow time to positively focus on leveraging worldwide operations experience . i value input from other trading operations professionals and i look forward to the ideas that can be generated in working with barry , richard and some of their direct reports . i also contacted tani nath about my trip to see how i could support her as she moves into her role in global products . i have not heard from tani , but i understand from others that she will be in the houston office next week . it will be unfortunate to miss her on my trip , but based on my commitments in houston and rick causey ' s desire to move forward on providing trading operations support to fernley , next week is the best for me to be in london . i did meet with tani for an hour when she was here week before last and offered to help her in any way if she made the decision to accept the role over global products . i trust that she will contact me for that support as needed . i have scheduled a short meeting one on one with you while i am there to discuss how my global role can provide support and resources for your business efforts in london . i look forward to meeting with you next week . this trip is not a leg of the worldwide operations / control review that we are conducting at joe sutton ' s request . by circumstance , as you know , we have taken a look at helsinki and subsequently oslo and frankfurt . there will be a similar review of continental power , uk gas , uk power and global liquids . the review teams are currently focused on operations / controls reviews of north american locations and some entities in the us in which enron has a large ownership position . it is likely that the continuation of this effort in london will occur in mid april . copies of the drafts of the findings for oslo and frankfurt were provided to fernley as soon as the team returned to houston . we hope to finalise those drafts this week as we receive comments from fernley and the business managers in oslo and frankfurt to whom those drafts were provided . fernley suggested that you would like to see the drafts as opposed to the final copies , so i will have those forwarded to you today . the sydney and singapore trip was a lengthy one , as it also involved a last leg of the trip in london with regard to support for singapore . the houston team returned the middle of last week and worked with aa on an early draft last friday . i can also provide you with a draft of that report , the completion of which was pending input from bill bradford early this week ( he made the trip but was out of the office last week ) . we did do a preliminary review of the sydney and singapore findings with rick causey and rick buy on friday afternoon , to accommodate the fact that both are out on vacation this week . they understood the preliminary nature of the draft that was reviewed with them .

Subject: p + option valuation model mark , after recently reviewing the booking of the p + options , it is my understanding that these options are being valued using a standard spread option model where the price evolution of the two legs of the spread are assumed to be correlated geometric brownian motion processes ( i . e . the price process assumptions are consistent with standard black - 76 model assumptions extended to two commodities ) . the payoff for a call option is : payoff = max ( 0 , a  ) b  ) k ) . where : a = nxwti ( delivery price for nymex ) b = posting price = ( wti swap )  ) ( posting basis ) k = posting bonus ( fixed ) . the only complication of this option as compared to most other spread options is that leg " b " of the spread is a combination of three prices , the two futures prices which make up the wti swap for the given month , and the average posting basis during the delivery month . combination of these prices is easily addressed by simply setting the volatility of leg " b " and the correlation to correctly account for the volatility of this basket of prices and its correlation with the nxwti price . i believe that this approach is more straightforward than the alternative , which would be to use a three or four - commodity model with its associated volatility and correlation matrices . in summary , i believe that this is an appropriate model for valuation of these types of options , assuming that the inputs are set correctly . regards , stinson gibner v . p . research

Subject: officials study grid ' s close call dave , kim : i think we should reference this article as an example of how price controls degrade reliability . bill , if you have any further insights on what happened that day , let dave perrino or sue mara know . thanks , alan officials study grid ' s close call published friday , aug . 10 , 2001 , in the san jose mercury news by steve johnson , john woolfolk and glennda chui mercury news two energy agencies announced thursday that they are investigating charges some california generators have disregarded orders to provide electricity , and atlanta - based mirant admitted it had a role in last week ' s incident that briefly imperiled the western power grid . california officials said two companies failed to deliver expected power on aug . 2 and pushed the grid dangerously close to collapse , threatening outages on the electrical lifeline to 65 million people . but it could take state and federal officials some time to sort through conflicting accounts of what led to the power shortfall and how to prevent it from happening again . some generators and a federal official questioned the california independent system operator ' s handling of the emergency and said the rules governing how power plants must respond to state orders for supplying electricity need to be clarified . but stephanie mccorkle with the california agency said the incident was just the latest in a series in which generators didn ' t follow orders . and she said state officials are particularly troubled at the reasons some of the firms involved have offered for falling short on delivering promised electricity . ` ` we asked them over and over why they ' re not following our dispatch instructions , ' ' she said , adding that some have provided ` ` explanations that don ' t add up . it makes us suspicious . ' ' mccorkle said the aug . 2 incident occurred when two power companies balked at state orders to provide power . that left the western grid - - a vast network of high - voltage lines , transformers and other electrical gear that spans 14 states and parts of canada and mexico - - with a sudden and severe electrical shortage . if uncorrected , she and others said , it could have led to widespread power outages . although officials need to keep the grid ' s electrical frequency at 60 hertz , the aug . 2 shortage lowered it to 59 . 93 hertz . state officials said blackouts could occur at 59 . 65 hertz . mccorkle declined to name the companies involved . but patrick dorinson , a spokesman for mirant , which has three plants in the bay area , said it was partly responsible . while offering few details about what happened , he blamed the incident on an inadvertent error by a company employee ` ` not making a timely call ' ' and ` ` some software problems with our computers . ' ' ` ` it happens , ' ' dorinson said . ` ` people make mistakes . ' ' an official with the federal energy regulatory commission , one of the agencies investigating the matter , said it views the aug . 2 incident with alarm and wants to ensure the problem doesn ' t happen again . the agency also intends to look into whether penalties are in order . but at this point , the official said , it ' s unclear whether the problem stemmed from confusion , incompetence or attempts to manipulate market prices . the official said the agency also wants to know why the california independent system operator didn ' t declare a statewide emergency on aug . 2 when the promised electricity wasn ' t delivered . had it done so , he said , the agency would have had more leverage over the generators . some power company representatives complained that the iso doesn ' t always give generators enough time to get their plants warmed up sufficiently to provide the power it needs . for many plants , ` ` it takes a lot longer than 10 minutes to ramp up , ' ' said richard wheatley , a spokesman with reliant energy of houston . ` ` you physically can ' t do it . ' ' but iso officials defended their procedures , and spokesman gregg fishman said issuing an emergency declaration on aug . 2 wouldn ' t have been feasible . ` ` this was so quick , ' ' he said . ` ` it was less than half an hour total from start to finish , and we were able to deal with it appropriately ' ' without suffering blackouts . the incident also is being looked into by the western systems coordinating council , a voluntary confederation of energy suppliers and utility officials , which sets rules for managing grids in the region ' s nearly 1 . 8 million square miles . robert dintelman , the agency ' s assistant executive director , said brief electricity fluctuations , such as the one that hit california or worse , occur once or twice a month across the west . on aug . 1 , for example , the frequency dipped to 59 . 75 in montana when an electrical disturbance forced a large power plant offline there , dintelman said . but he said california ' s claim that generators aren ' t following orders is unusual . ` ` that is alarming , ' ' he added . the council can issue fines for some rule violations . but dintelman said he ' s not sure if they can be levied for defying orders to deliver power . nationally , such violators typically get away with little more than a slap on the wrist because penalties are so weak , said ellen vancko of the north american electric reliability council . her group has been pushing congress to make the system tougher , but the legislation has stalled . meanwhile , she said , grid rule violations appear to be on the rise nationwide . although the motivation for these incidents varies , she said , sometimes those responsible break the rules for no other reason than to benefit themselves , ` ` even if it means dragging down the frequency on the entire grid and putting everybody at risk .

Subject: meeting with energy secretary martens i had an hour long , fruitful meeting with energy secretary martens last night . he was very supportive of our import project for industrials but , i did not convince him on the concept of cfe ' s bids ( i . e . rio bravo iv ) to be modified , so as to call for ipp or ppa ' s ( imported power ) indifferently . he gave me two solid arguments : - cfe ( i . e . mexico ) cannot depend on imported power from the us ( texas ) on a long term basis ( 25 years ) , since there is no formal agreement between both countries that will support it . this is an even stronger argument after the september 11 th events , when the us can call for national emergencies whenever needed . secretary martens shared with me the problems they faced in baja california during the california energy crisis , when natural gas supply was cut out , on three or four occasions , because of a state government emergency decree ( i . e . supply contracts between sdge and cfe were not honored ) . - we are very late to request modifications on the rio bravo iv bid , which has been postponed for early december . he offered to look into it for 2002 bids , providing the bilateral agreement is in place . regarding the import project for industrials , he volunteered his support with tamsa , axa , desc or deacero , since the concept of importing / trading power in the ercot market , is a good story for him to sell . finally , he told me that the transmission cost methodology will be available by the end of this month ( he hopes that the cre will load it in its internet site ) . regards , jaime _ _ _ _ _ _ _

Subject: the storage revolution has begun network world fusion focus : amy larsen decarlo on storage in the enterprise today ' s focus : the storage revolution has begun 03 / 07 / 00 dear wincenty kaminski , today ' s focus : the storage revolution has begun by amy larsen decarlo believe the hype . we are in the middle of a storage revolution . virtually overnight , businesses have gone from storing gigabytes to terabytes of data , and the number of users accessing that information is skyrocketing . the subsequent requirements are forcing companies to rethink their storage strategies and to recognize the importance of storage management in the equation of efficient information delivery . it isn  , t just the volume of data or the higher scalability demands that are changing how businesses handle storage . the premium that companies place on much of their enterprise information is having a profound effect on their storage requirements . businesses demand fault - tolerant storage systems that deliver swift and reliable data access to their employees , suppliers and customers . but given the fact that hard disk capacity requirements , on average , double every 12 months , while processor speeds double every 18 months , companies are left with a quandary : how can they manage the proliferation of stored information efficiently enough to compensate for the differential between capacity requirements and processor speeds ? the simple answer to this question is to institute a well - executed storage management plan that anticipates capacity requirements in advance and leverages the best technologies and techniques to support those needs . bear in mind that the majority of storage costs come not from the equipment but from the implementation and support of those systems . there are several ways to efficiently manage storage . one of the best routes is consolidation that is , pooling resources and managing storage as a system , as opposed to a decentralized collection of file servers . this may sound like a throwback to an earlier era , when enterprise storage resided on mainframes . but it  , s actually a progressive step , as the consolidation has more to do with centralizing the planning , management , and ongoing support of storage systems than it does with the physical location of the files . next , it is important to recognize that not all information is equally important to the organization . consequently , storage requirements vary by business application . as in all areas of it , it is important to make storage implementation decisions based on business needs . businesses trying to more efficiently manage storage are looking for alternatives to the distributed file server storage model . they want to speed access to stored files and remove bandwidth - intensive backup and recovery operations from the lan . network - attached storage ( nas ) supplies it professionals with one answer , giving workstations and servers a way to gain direct access to stored data . nas devices , which have been widely available for years , are optimized to process i / o transactions . though they promise better performance , they don  , t remove backups from the transport network . instead , they supply a relatively easy - to - deploy solution to cross - platform storage problems for most heterogeneous environments . many consider storage - area networks ( san ) to be the best long - term answer to current and future storage challenges . because sans are designed with a topology separate from the corporate data network , they alleviate many of the availability and performance issues associated with more traditional storage models . yet , given the early deployment stage most companies are still in , many of those capabilities are still largely untested in a production environment . this newsletter will examine how , through effective storage management , it professionals can reduce support costs and improve service delivery to their customers . this newsletter will not focus on items like the least expensive tape drive or the fast tape library . instead , it will look at how businesses can reduce inefficiencies and leverage emerging technologies to resolve their particular storage application issues . ultimately , the goal is to identify storage technology options and practices that work in real - world environments . to contact amy larsen decarlo : - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - amy larsen decarlo is an analyst with enterprise management associates in boulder , colo . , ( http : / / www . . com ) , a leading analyst and market research firm focusing exclusively on all aspects of enterprise management . she focuses on storage management , application management , and security . in her position , she oversees market research and contributes to custom project work in her focal coverage areas . prior to joining ema , amy spent five years covering enterprise management for industry trade magazines , including informationweek and data communications . she can be reached at mailto : decarlo @ . com for related links - - click here for network world ' s home page : http : / / www . nwfusion . com the national storage industry consortium ( nsic ) http : / / www . nsic . org the distributed management task force ( dmtf ) http : / / www . dmtf . org storage systems standards working group of the ieee http : / / www . ssswg . org the ietf http : / / www . ietf . org subscription services to subscribe or unsubscribe to any network world e - mail newsletters , go to : to change your email address , go to : subscription questions ?

( wes please sort out unless jim has any problems with the above methodology ) . thanks louise

Subject: cleco deals 449243 & 397957 / state tract 121 ( meter 785 ) fred or anita , i just wanted to recap our discussion to be sure that we are all on the same page . from my understanding , the allocation for meter 785 : state tract 121 is supplied from bryancy braumley . prior to 09 / 1 / 00 bryancy would calculate flow from certain wellheads , total this volume , and then send us an allocation that would show how much gas was allocated to texas general land and hpl ( sale from cleco ) at meter 785 . effective 09 / 1 / 00 a compressor was put in and the gas from 785 now flows through this compressor , as well as the gas from meter 9662 ( deal 137595 sales from dewbre ) , and is now measured at meter 3527 : tivoli station . for bryancy ' s allocation , she must take the meter statement from meter 3527 and deduct meter 9662 ' s flow . once this is done , she can take that net number and do an allocation between texas general land and hpl ( cleco ) like she has done previously . i believe meter 785 is now a check meter and meter 3527 is the actual pay meter . for 9 / 00 there were two deals in place for the sale from cleco , deal 397957 and 449243 . per discussions with daren farmer , danny conner , and jennifer martinez , i have been instructed to zero out the deal for 397957 and use 449243 as the correct deal number . therefore , fred boas and i have zeroed out the 397957 deal and placed the volume that was allocated there to deal 449243 . deal 397957 was priced at ship less . 18 which was incorrect and deal 449243 is priced at ship less . 15 . therefore , an adjustment will generate for 9 / 00 for the difference in price and the change in location . the allocated volume for cleco did not change . however , i am not sure that bryancy is allocating the volume properly between texas general land and hpl ( cleco ) . i have spoke to her , as well as jennifer martinez , and curtis funderbruk with cleco so there might be some pma ' s for volume differences . in addition , i have changed the allocation method at meter 3527 to be a callout \ swing effect 9 / 00 . for october and succeeding months , the volume should be computed by taking meter 3527 deducting out meter 9662 . then byancy should take this net number and split it between texas general land and hpl ( cleco ) . the texas general land nom is currently at meter 785 and the hpl ( cleco ) deal is at meter 3527 . fred mentioned that the texas general land nom might need to be moved to meter 3527 but nothing has been decided on that yet . please let me know if something i have stated is not your understanding or you need something more done on my end . also , let me know who is going to be doing this monthly allocation . it might be beneficial to have one person doing all the points ( meters 3527 , 9662 , 785 ) . thanks for your help ! ! !

Subject: enron tiger team dear jeff , our tiger team very much enjoyed your presentation about enron global markets on friday . given that we have latitude in our project scope , our team would like to assist enron in evaluating a new market opportunity . you mentioned several markets that enron is considering in 2001 , including transportation , cement , coffee , cocoa , sugar , etc . we believe that a project of this sort will give us the opportunity to really learn how enron creates value , what its business model and core competencies are , and how they can be translated to a new market . furthermore , we can get an in - depth understanding of an industry . we believe our project will complement any analysis that your business group is currently undertaking . please propose the top three new markets that you would like us to evaluate for enron . upon receipt of your proposal , perhaps we could set up a conference call to discuss your thoughts and to make a final selection . your expeditious response is appreciated . regards , josh leventhal 215 - 546 - 2103
Subject: eol trade size discrepancies vince - i have discovered the two sources of discrepancy in the " transaction dollars " on eol , between my numbers and those of eol . first , eol records all index trades with the henry hub price ( since the index price isn ' t , inadvertently , recorded with the trade , as i told you ) , whereas i went back and appended the contemporaneous index price to the trades . second , eol ignores all basis trades in reporting transaction dollars , whereas i append a rough size to them of the " price " as the basis , times the quantity . i ' m sorry i wasn ' t ready in time with my numbers ; i took the task of accuracy very seriously . clayton

( b ) how enron is disciplining the internal decision making process with market . this is in many ways the critical aspect of real options that most finance people miss - - having options is one thing but exercising them and realizing their value is another . all of the incomplete contracting , asymmetric information , and incentive issues are ignored in real options valuation models . but they are real in practice . my impression is enron ' s real success is in putting place an organization that is able to mitigate these problems by imposing a market disciplining . ( c ) how enron manages the various books that involve physicals , financials , credit etc . this is specially important when many of the real assets have options features and therefore , include non - linear risk profiles . the story of gas is pretty well understood but not many of the others markets enron has been moving into over the last few years . on the gmii front , i think that some interesting opportunities arise when you think of the spectrum in a way similar to that of dark fiber . i am working with several people at lucent on this issue . i think it would be wonderful to engage in a conversation with enron and lucent folks in the room . i can do a lunch time talk on any of these issues . perhaps we can discuss some of these over a conference call . clearly , having vince kaminski in the room would be very important to me . as for schedules , the first 3 weeks of april are horrible . april 26 / 27 , may 3 / 4 are good for me . regards nalin at 06 : 56 pm 03 / 22 / 2001 , mack , iris wrote : > hi , > > as we briefly discussed , i spoke with one of my colleagues ( dr . > martin lin ) about your visiting enron to give a talk and to spend some > time with us to discuss you work in telecommunications , real options , > etc . > > martin and i are working on various broadband related problems . > > we thought it might be helpful if you let us know a bit more about > the following : > * when you want to come ( the research group has weekly > catered lunch on thursday and brown bag lunches on every other friday ) . > > * a description of what you want to talk about with respect > to telecoms , broadband , etc . > * who you would like to meet with me - vince kaminski ( our > boss ) , any other of our colleagues in research , broadband , etc . > . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . etc . > > > > > look forward to hearing from you . > > regards , > iris

Subject: pancanadian buys montana power note : this article gives some of the strategy and economics of the purchase of montana power by pan canadian . we will look at the oklahoma reserves for location and strategy with our pipe - - with the switch in ownership , they may be receptive to strategy changes . lorna pancanadian says montana power purchase ' beautiful fit ' to extend what it sees as dominance in canada ' s natural gas market and to boost its production by 10 % , pancanadian petroleum ltd . yesterday agreed to purchase montana power co . for $ 475 million . the properties will extend pancanadian ' s existing shallow gas properties in southern alberta into northern montana , adding 94 mmcf / d and 3 , 800 barrels of crude oil and natural gas liquids . the acquisition will give pancanadian properties in alberta , montana , colorado , oklahoma and wyoming , along with three gas pipelines linking alberta and saskatchewan to montana . " we have a focus on natural gas , " said ceo david tuer during a conference call yesterday in calgary . " this is clearly our future . it is difficult to put any negative on this ( acquisition ) and it ' s likely to stay valuable for the foreseeable future . " montana power ' s production is more than 90 % natural gas and associated liquids , and the acquisition substantially extends pancanadian ' s land and infrastructure , allowing it to use its technology and operating strategies in a region that extends along the alberta - montana border . " the montana power assets clearly fit our strengths and allow us to employ our expertise in developing long life reserves of shallow and medium depth natural gas , " tuer said . " the potential in these assets is significant , and over the next few years , we will add substantially to pancanadian ' s daily natural gas production . " tuer said that the acquisition extends the company ' s dominance in shallow gas , and called montana power a " beautiful fit with pancanadian ' s gas strategy , land position and technological capability . " pancanadian ' s newest acquisition adds reserves of 550 bcf and 20 mm barrels of oil and natural gas liquids on a proven and one - half probable basis , said officials . production and reserves account for $ 520 million of the purchase price , while the remainder is made up of $ 135 million for the midstream and marketing assets , $ 40 million for the undeveloped land ( about 600 , 000 acres ) , and $ 7 million of working capital . tuer said the company was paying 77 cents / mcfe of proven and on - half probable reserves . the price for daily flowing production , based on a 6 : 1 ration of gas to boe is $ 4 , 450 / mcfe , or $ 26 , 710 / boe . along with the added alberta and montana properties , pancanadian also picks up some land in colorado ' s denver basin , which now produces about 31 mmcf / d . other land that is part of the sale is located in the anadarko basin of oklahoma and the green river basin of wyoming . three natural gas pipelines that cross from montana into alberta and saskatchewan also are included . the pipelines allow direct access to the u . s . markets for southern alberta and saskatchewan gas , and serve more than 1 . 2 million net acres of developed and undeveloped lands , with most of it concentrated in parcels that span the canada - montana border . midstream assets that go to pancanadian include a natural gas marketing company in butte , mt , along with a deep cut gas processing and fractionation plant in colorado . the fort lupton , co plant processes more than 60 mmcf / d and 5 , 500 barrels of natural gas liquids and condensate . in all , the total developed and undeveloped land is roughly 1 . 2 million net acres , or 1 . 7 million gross acres , said pancanadian . " montana power fit us like a glove , " tuer said during the conference call . he said the acquisition will help pancanadian to remain " best of class " for what it does . " it makes our sandbox that much bigger . " the acquisition , which is expected to close around oct . 31 , will increase both pancanadian ' s net income and cash flow this year and in subsequent years , said tuer . the added gas production will immediately increase the company ' s natural gas , as a percentage of total production , to 58 % , based on a 6 : 1 ratio of gas to boe . about 25 % of the natural gas being acquired from montana power now is being sold to montana power utilities for $ 1 . 50 to $ 1 . 60 mmcf until july 2002 , and because it ' s priced below the open market officials think future earnings will be good . " as that contract expires , there ' s a lot of potential from the price in this transaction , " tuer said . and what ' s to become of montana power ? earlier this year , the 88 - year - old company , headquartered in butte , announced it would divest itself of four of its traditional energy businesses . by selling its coal production , natural gas transmission and distribution , independent power production and oil and gas exploration and production businesses , it plans to reinvest the proceeds in touch america , a fiber optics and telecommunications business , which is also a subsidiary of montana power . " the process to determine the buyer for our oil and gas business was robust , and we are delighted with the result , " said montana power ceo robert p . gannon . " we believe there will be a meshing of business strategies and that cultural synergy ' s exist between the purchased companies and pan canadian . " he noted that montana power has had a canadian presence for almost 50 years . pancanadian purchased the entire oil and gas division , which now employs about 170 . pancanadian plans to maintain a regional office in butte , invest in the acquired properties and grow daily gas production . there was no word on whether any jobs would be lost . - -

c ) ena is the leading energy merchant by a factor of two ; d ) physical electricity volume grew by 34 % ytd 1999 to ytd 2000 forecast ; e ) natural gas volumes grew by 82 % ytd 1999 to ytd 2000 forecast ; f ) 500 % growth in daily transactions from november 1999 to november 2000 due to the highly successful enron online distribution channel ; and g ) ena reaching its 25 % roce target . these are truly outstanding accomplishments and our expectations for growth and opportunity in enron north america for 2001 are consistent with that success . in order to reach these goals , we felt it necessary to re - align a number of our organizations . a number of these changes are completed . the goals of such re - alignment include : a ) increase overall productivity with the goal to ensure that every employee is in a position to contribute regardless of skill set ; b ) increase overall market coverage , deal flow and information generation with the goal to increase bid / offer income , increase the velocity of deal flow , improve customer coverage and promote quality information transfer to our trading organization ; c ) increase deal quality and earnings quality with the goal to ( i ) allocate our resources towards the best transactions and ( ii ) significantly increase our  d ) promote real time decision making and a closer tie between our trading and origination ( mid - market and structured ) organizations in order to better align those functions to reduce the amount of un - productive internal focus ; e ) increase the overall velocity of the capital being utilized consistent with our goal of a 25 % plus return on capital employed ; and f ) identify and recognize a host of new leaders in the organization that are critical to meeting our goals next year . with these objectives in mind , patterned after the successful business models in calgary and portland , effective immediately the following changes are being implemented : a ) east power  ) a single east power team incorporating trading , mid - market and origination will be formed under the co - leadership of kevin presto and janet dietrich who will report to the enron americas - office of the chairman ( ea ooc ) . this team will have one income statement , one book and a joint accountability . however , a clear delineation of responsibilities inside these teams will continue to exist in which the trading organization will manage the risk , income statement and product development aspects of the partnership . the originators will have the primary responsibility to generate origination income , provide coverage , deal flow , lead strategy formulation , provide information and generate strategic positions . overall , the team will be rewarded based upon increasing the value of the book , meeting coverage / deal flow targets and meeting its strategic / growth goals in the eastern power markets . the team will be responsible for covering the iou  , s , muni  , s / co - ops , industrials and ipp  , s and will utilize all ena  , s product capabilities including the power commodity , assets and capital . the team will further be broken down into several key strategic regions and business units including : ( i ) ercot  ) managed by doug gilbert smith and bruce sukaly ; ( ii ) ne  ) managed by dana davis and jeff ader ; ( iii ) midwest  ) managed by fletch sturm and ed baughman ; ( iv ) se  ) managed by rogers herndon and ozzie pagan ; ( v ) east power development  ) managed by ben jacoby ; ( vi ) east power structuring - managed by bernie aucoin ; and ( vii ) east power fundamentals and the  east gas  ) a single east gas team incorporating trading , mid - market and origination will be formed under the co - leadership of scott neal and frank vickers who will be returning from portland to join this team . west gas  ) in a similar manner , a west gas team will be formed co - managed by phillip allen and barry tycholiz , who will be joining us in houston from the canadian team . the denver office under mark whitt will be integrated under this team . central gas  ) in a similar manner , a central gas team will be formed co - managed by hunter shively and laura luce . the chicago office will be integrated into this team . texas gas  ) the texas gas team will be managed by tom martin . this team will continue to manage the gas trading business around hpl until the pending sale is concluded in q 2 2001 . after the sale of hpl , this team will build a texas gas business without ownership of the hpl assets . financial  ) this group will continue to be managed by john arnold with no significant changes . derivatives  ) this group , lead by fred lagrasta , will offer derivative and financial mid - market products and services to the natural gas market specifically targeting cfo  , s and treasury departments . fred will continue to maintain certain existing mid - market accounts with a number of producer and industrial accounts where relationships are well formed . otherwise , mid - market coverage will gravitate to the regions . the new york office gas marketing efforts will continue to be managed by fred . upstream products  ) this group , lead by jean mrha , will develop several distinct product offerings for the upstream segment of the gas market . this group will develop and market the product in conjunction with the regions . this is consistent with our desire to have a broader product offering and greater market penetration in the upstream segment . these products include producer outsourcing , similar to our successful petro - canada and suncor relationships in canada , physical storage re - engineering , compressor services , wellhead liquidity products and offshore asset and capital products . in addition , jean will manage our bridgeline joint venture with texaco . gas structuring  ) this group will be lead by ed mcmichael , reporting to frank vickers , will provide structuring and deal support to all the gas teams . gas fundamentals  ) this group will be lead by chris gaskill , reporting to hunter shively , will provide fundamentals to all the gas teams . julie gomez will continue to support the gas floor through several identified projects including long - term supply / demand analysis and , natural gas transportation capacity trading opportunities . there is an expectation of some customer overlap between the gas and power groups ; for example , the combination utilities and the ipp  , s . the teams will coordinate with regard to the combination utilities like con . edison or pg & e . with regard to the ipp  , s , to the extent that the product offering involves an underlying power position , the power teams will manage . we have asked janet dietrich to coordinate such overlaps between the two organizations in houston . e ) technical / restructuring - in the effort to consolidate and centralize our technical resources ( engineering , development , operations , pipeline ) to ensure that this skill base is available to all ena groups and utilized productively across the organization , brian redmond will form and manage the technical services group . this group will manage ena  , s technical risks and will provide , on a cost basis , technical services for the entire ena organization . this group will manage the interface with ee therefore , eliminating the need to change legal entities et al . if you are currently a commercial employee of ena or esa you will continue to conduct business in that company . we look forward to another exciting year in the north american energy market . this is certainly a company unrivaled in the marketplace with the most talented employees . the opportunities are endless . we wish you and your family a very happy and safe holiday season .

' s oil - to - natural - gas converted pipeline from the four corners of new mexico remains stymied in operating its portion within california under a newly revised " peaking tariff " for southern california gas co . , according to questar officials who have been analyzing the new rate established aug . 2 by state regulators . questar is looking at alternative uses for the california portion of the approved interstate pipeline . " we can ' t work with ( the rate ) as it is , " said chad jones , a questar spokesperson . " it definitely doesn ' t go far enough to remove the obstacles in the way of developing new pipelines in southern california . it still doesn ' t level the playing field . although it is better than the current rls ( residual load service ) tariff ; it still punishes customers who want to take partial service from a socalgas competitor . " customers still have to pay higher interruptible penalties than in other parts of the state , and higher rates for balancing services . we ' re at the point where we ' re not going to stop trying to market capacity on southern trails , but we ' re definitely at the point where we have to consider some alternative uses for the california portion ( of the 700 - miles , 16 - inch - diameter pipeline ) . " one of the alternatives would be to operate the california part of the line as a petroleum or liquids line carrying product from the long beach harbor area to existing petroleum or liquid products pipelines in and around the california - arizona border . that ' s the alternative , however , jones said , but finding a customer for a major portion of the converted pipeline ' s 120 mmcf / d capacity is still questar ' s preference . after months of reviewing the issue and weighing alternatives , the california public utilities commission last week established a new " peaking " or standby charge for customers taking partial service from a socalgas competitor , allowing those customers to pay only for the amounts of gas they use at any given time from the local gas transmission and distribution utility , socalgas . the cpuc tried to balance the need for the local gas utility to be made whole so added fixed costs did not have to be shifted to other customers , while trying to " encourage and promote additional natural gas resources without encouraging cherry - picking or overbuilding , " according to cpuc president loretta lynch . questar officials said tuesday they have pretty much exhausted their appeal resources , and they are " not about to go head - to - head with the established big boys " in lobbying california ' s governor or state legislature , jones said . " thus , we ' re still looking for a large customer who would be willing to break the gridlock in southern california in the name of promoting competition .

Subject: california update 6 / 19 / 01 executive summary ? angelides to announce bridge loan financing ? us senate democrats go back & forth with ferc ? sdg & e line sale overview ? california dwr contracts add tension ? ge accommodates western power sellers ? pg & e executives profit even in bankruptcy angelides to announce bridge loan financing as reported on the wires and confirmed by sources , state treasurer , angelides will announce a $ 4 . 3 b bridge loan today at 2 pm pst . the majority of the loan will be provided by j . p . morgan chase and lehman brothers . us senates withdraws price cap legislation , almost in response to yesterday ' s ferc order , the senate energy committee chairman bingaman , and california us senators feinstein and boxer have decided to temporarily withdraw legislation aimed at setting wholesale power price caps in western states . the action displays an effort by lawmakers to acknowledge both bush ' s and ferc ' s meek spirit of cooperativeness and allow some time to determine the order ' s effectiveness . at least one legislator remains unsatisfied as sources report that sen . gordon smith ( r - oregon ) plans to author a bill by july that would attempt to extend the one year term on yesterdays ferc order to cover the northwest ' s power shortages winter 2002 . acknowledging the seasonal power swap between california and its northern neighbors , smith views current mitigation plan covering two california summers , and only one northwest winter , as unfair . sdg & e line sale through this deal , sempra and the state assert that san diego gas & electric ' s $ 750 m undercollect can be eliminated without a state purchase of sdg & e ' s transmission assets , which is the only element of the deal that would have to be approved by the legislature . ( this is a key difference between this agreement and the socal mou . ) the other tenets of the deal would only have to be approved by the puc . in other words , sempra claims that it will be able to eliminate sdg & e ' s undercollect just by dealing with the puc rather than the legislature . sources suggest that this may be in reaction to the failure of the socal mou to move in the legislature . sources also indicate that the earlier trans - elect offer to purchase sdg & e lines for ( $ 1 . 8 b ) considerably less than the states bid only makes the california legislature more leery of approving the socal mou . mou attached below . davis kindles new fire over dwr contracts friday ' s release of the cadwr power contracts motioned republicans to begin a new wave of complaints against the governor remarking that the contract information was lacking and data that the public has a right to know had been blacked out . assembly member dave cox ( minority leader ) stated that the most troubling items were the clauses that exempt generators from having to pay windfall profit taxes or environmental penalties , and instead these would be paid by taxpayers . backlash from the republicans has been increasing as a new wave of california television commercials peg davis as the root of california ' s energy woes . ge out west sources report that there are 3 or 4 ge generator sets ( peaker plants ) on the market now for $ 14 - $ 15 m . this is because the people who bought these units do not want to go forward and get into the california market because it is " too arbitrary . " sources report that the sellers of these generator sets made this decision beginning approximately a week ago . additionally , sources believe that ge may move to cost - plus - based pricing for sellers of power in order to provide stable financing for generators over the long term , though this would mean less profits than in the past . pg & e executives profit even in bankruptcy as reported on 6 - 14 , sources continue to believe that socal executives are closely following the events unfolding in the pg & e bankruptcy case , as mentioned in last thursday ' s report " judge montali approved large bonuses for pg & e senior management after pg & e ' s filing made bryson and other members of his team " reconsider " the merits of bankruptcy . " today ' s news reports of judge montali ' s order providing pg & e executive with $ 17 . 5 m in bonuses just reiterates the point to bryson that pg & e executives remain well - paid even in bankruptcy thus suggesting socal could do equally well in the event of a filing . sources suggest that socal ' s current cash position weighs less heavily in determining a bankruptcy filing than the prospect of asset seizures / liens ( however , sources continue to make inquiries as to socal ' s cash flow situation . )
Subject: california energy crisis california ' s power crisis has generated heated debate over the last several months . unfortunately , this debate has generated more heat than light . we want you to know what the facts are and what we are doing about the crisis . please spend a few minutes reading the following overview on the situation and our position on california energy issues . what happened in california the source of california ' s current problem is as straightforward as supply and demand . california ' s economy grew 29 percent since 1998 . this increased the demand for electricity by 24 percent . at the same time , regulatory restrictions prevented new generation from getting built in the state . so demand grew but regulations prevented supplies from being added . the result , predictably , is a shortage . this summer , peak capacity will be about 10 percent shy of peak demand , leading to further blackouts in the state . in addition to the supply and demand imbalance , there are two other related factors that led to the current crisis . first , the state ' s regulations forced all sales and purchases into the spot market . the spot market for power is extraordinarily volatile . the way firms behave in a free market when faced with such volatility is to construct a portfolio of purchases long term , medium term and short term , to reduce exposure to this volatility . in california , state regulation prevented this strategy . this would be the equivalent of putting the entire state on an adjustable rate mortgage in the most volatile interest rate environment imaginable . everything was fine while the power surplus persisted , but when shortages ensued , every megawatt was purchased at the sky rocketing spot price . second , retail markets were not deregulated . regulated retail rates remained in effect , and stranded cost recovery charges were structured to keep competition out . this meant that utilities were forced to pay high wholesale prices in the spot market but were only able to recover costs at the regulated retail rate . they are now nearly bankrupt . in short , california ' s problems were caused by regulation , not deregulation . regulations prevented competitors from entering the market , prevented new generation from being built , and prevented prudent hedging against volatile spot prices . at the time california was developing its restructuring plan , enron warned the state ' s policy makers about these risks and proposed alternatives , which , if adopted , would have averted the current crisis . enron ' s role many political leaders in the state have elected to fix blame rather than fix the problem . power sellers , including enron , have been vilified by the politicians and the media . here are the facts : ? other than a small amount of wind power , enron is not a generator in the state of california . every megawatt we sold in california we bought in the same market available to other california purchasers . because we are a market maker , not a generator , we are not biased toward high prices . we are interested only in having a market that works so that we can package products for our customers . ? as a seller to end - use markets in the state , we provided protection from the problems the states ' utilities , and their customers , now face . we protected , and still protect , our customers from price volatility . you may have read that ees recently elected to have the utilities supply power directly to its customers in california instead of procuring power on the open market . early reports mischaracterized this as a " turnback " of our customers to the utilities . here are the facts : ? as a result of a variety of factors existing in the current california market , it made more sense for ees to source power for its customers directly from the utilities . this decision reduced ees ' s market price risk by allowing ees to access lower utility rates . ? ees did not terminate any customer contracts , and our customers continue to receive the financial benefits of their contract prices . ? ees is continuing to work with its california customers to provide them with other energy - related products and services , including assistance in reducing the demand for power , particularly at peak times . enron is currently proposing solutions to help california work out of its crisis ; enron continues to sign up customers in the state ; and enron continues to actively manage its risks and capture opportunities in western power markets . enron ' s primary business is managing risk for our customers with solutions customized to meet their needs . there has never been more demand for our products and services . the solution the solution to california ' s crisis is also straightforward . in summary , the state must increase supply , reduce demand , reduce reliance on the spot market and shore up the financial stability of the state ' s utilities . increasing supply california ' s process for siting and permitting new generation is nothing short of byzantine . enron has built plants elsewhere in the country in less than a year . in california , it often takes 5 to 7 years . california simply must streamline this process . ironically , while many of the regulations generators must overcome are aimed at improving environmental quality , the regulations are preventing new clean technology from coming online and displacing current plants , which emit 40 times as much nox . california can have abundant power and cleaner air by expediting the permitting of new facilities . reducing demand customers in california today have no incentive to reduce or shift demand . they pay the same rate no matter what the market price is . an open retail market would trigger demand responses , which would balance supply and demand at lower prices than today . california should fully open its retail market . reducing reliance on the spot market in a truly deregulated market , customers would protect themselves from volatile spot prices by purchasing some of their requirements on a longer term , fixed - price basis . the state has instead left procurement in the hands of the utilities , which it has forced to buy exclusively in the spot market . opening the market at the retail level will give customers control over their price risk . restoring the financial integrity of the state ' s institutions the utilities in california are not paying their bills . this has led to greater uncertainty in the market , higher costs , and reduced flexibility to arrive at lasting solutions . california must permit its utilities to recover their costs so they can pay their bills and invest in the transmission and distribution assets necessary to get power from where it is to where it is needed . just as important as doing these things , the state must avoid policies that , while politically attractive , do not fix the problem or even make matters worse . price caps have been proposed . they don ' t work ; have never worked ; and they will not work here . price caps succeed only in creating shortages , which then have to be allocated among competing users . imagine how ineffectively the government would be in determining , for example , whether it is better to make its limited power supplies available to the imperial valley or silicon valley . price caps are a surefire way to make the current shortage worse . the state has also proposed to take over generation and transmission in california . there is no reason to believe , and every reason to doubt , that the state will be more effective than free markets at investing in , constructing , operating and maintaining assets . this will also result in california tax revenues being spent on power transmission and power generation - - which the private sector can do - - instead of education , roads and other public goods - - which the private sector cannot do . as you are approached by people outside the company or are learning about the crisis from the media , it ' s important for you to know this : we at enron will continue to serve our customers and we will continue to propose real solutions to the state .

" i am proud of the work done by the assembly to get the state out of the business of buying electricity by restoring edison to creditworthiness . unfortunately , however , the senate has not gotten the job done . " it is critical to keep edison solvent so that we do not lose 3 , 000 megawatts of power from renewable energy and small power producers . we worked hard to bring this energy , which was crucial in avoiding blackouts , back on - line earlier this summer .

( ap ) - - the state senate adjourned early saturday without voting on a plan to rescue southern california edison from bankruptcy , and gov . gray davis called an emergency legislative session for next month to try again to help the struggling utility . as the california legislature rushed to pass hundreds of bills and finish the 2001 session , a $ 200 million program to help the state ' s neediest schools won approval . so did bills to give driver ' s licenses to immigrants seeking citizenship and improve working conditions for shepherds . but senators remained cool to davis ' idea of bailing out southern california edison . they failed to vote on the measure after it was approved last week by the assembly , which also adjourned early saturday . " we didn ' t take it up because we didn ' t want to embarrass the governor , " said president pro tem john burton . " it would have been a rip - off of residential people to help big business and bail out a corporation . " the deal ' s quiet death closed more than five months of work since davis first announced the plan in april , saying the state would pay $ 2 . 76 billion for edison ' s transmission system and let the utility sell consumer - backed bonds to repay the rest of its $ 3 . 9 billion debt . without the deal , edison faces bankruptcy along with pacific gas and electric co . , the state ' s largest utility . the company filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in april , after amassing about $ 8 . 9 billion in debt due to last year ' s sky - high electricity costs . edison says it has accrued $ 3 . 9 billion in debts . the special session is meant to take another shot at saving edison from sliding into bankruptcy . " i am proud of the work done by the assembly to get the state out of the business of buying electricity by restoring edison to creditworthiness , " davis in a statement after midnight saturday . " unfortunately , however , the senate has not gotten the job done . " the new school - improvement program would provide grants of $ 400 per student to schools with the state ' s lowest test scores . they will have nearly four years to improve scores or face sanctions as severe as closing the school . the shepherd bill would give people who watch sheep some of the basic working conditions that other workers have in state law . those include a 10 - minute rest break for every four hours of work , tools paid for by the employer and toilets , lights and water in housing . it also would put into state law a $ 1 , 050 - a - month minimum wage for sheepherders . while legislators toiled , tuesday ' s terrorist attacks were never far from their minds . davis joined the assembly for a brief memorial service that included a procession of lawmakers handing in letters they had written expressing their feeling about the attacks . the legislature approved sending $ 1 million from the california victim compensation fund to a similar program in new york to help victims of the terrorist attacks . the letters will be printed in a special assembly journal . " here in california , our job is to keep the peace and preach tolerance , " said davis . ? 2001 associated press

Subject: transcript of a bizarre and unusual telephone call from the iso here is the transcript of the iso ' s real - time desk asking enron real - time trader ryan slinger to help the iso " set " the market - clearing price ( " mcp " ) for replacement energy . the iso wanted enron to help set the mcp for replacement energy at $ 91 . 86 , because the iso was upset that the mcp had dropped to a penny , and now market participants were buying the iso ' s excess energy a penny ( after having sold it to the iso for $ 91 the day before ) . there are two phone calls . the first call is the iso calling to ask us to help it to set the price . the next call occurs three minutes later and is the iso calling because we didn ' t put in the bid . our trader told the iso that he had to " talk to his boss " because he " didn ' t want to do anything wrong . " note : i have just learned a complicating detail : coincidentally , our desk did put in a bid for $ 91 . 86 for hour 18 , which was what the iso had requested . however , the bid had been formulated before the iso called our desk . transcription of a telephone conversation between the iso ' s real time desk and enron ' s real time desk - july 3 , 2001 , 14 : 40 : 50 - 14 . 43 : 38 enron : enron , this is david [ porter ] . iso : hi david . this is allen at the iso . enron : david : hi allen . how ya doing ? iso : allen : hold on one sec . i ' ve got to get something . unknown : stage one at 11 . iso : allen : hey , i ' m on the hour - ahead desk . did you guys put a bid in ? enron : david : yes , hang on one second allen . iso : allen : yeah . enron : ryan : this is ryan [ slinger ] . iso : allen : hey ryan , this is allen at the iso hour ahead . did you guys put a trade in , replacement [ energy ] ? not trade , but a bid ? enron : ryan : for which hour , for hour 15 ? iso : allen : for hour 16 ? enron : ryan : for hour 16 , correct . iso : allen : can you guys continue to put the price at that ? enron : ryan : at what ? at $ 91 . 86 ? iso : allen : yes enron : ryan : um , ? . iso : allen : this isn ' t on a recorded line , but we wanted to do that because of some of the things that we are seeing . it would be good to keep it [ the market clearing price for replacement energy ] at a higher price . it doesn ' t matter how many megawatts you put it at , but we want to clear it at a higher price . enron : ryan : wait , you said we ' re not on a recorded line , or we are ? iso : allen : we ' re not . no , we ' re not , okay . we already talked to the day - ahead research guy and myself , but we saw you guys clear at $ 91 and we wanted you , if it ' s possible , to continue to set that , whether it ' s 20 mw or whatever you want to put in there . enron : ryan : okay , um ? . . iso : allen : we want to clear it at that because of some issues we are seeing as far as others that are taking advantage of the market . enron : ryan : oh yeah . because it had been clearing like at $ 100 , hadn ' t it ? iso : allen : not replacement . enron : ryan : oh , not replacement ? iso : allen : no . what happened is that we bought it back ? . see , the day - ahead was purchased at like $ 100 and then what happened is that the hour - ahead . . . a bunch of these people were buying it back for a penny over the [ inter ] ties . they were faking it . so we wanted to keep the price up high . allen and ryan : unintelligible . enron : ryan : so they were selling it , oh , in the day ahead , and buying it back ? . iso : allen : buying like 60 bucks . . . trying to make money off of it , then basically they are trying to buy it back at a penny . enron : ryan : oh , that ' s ridiculous . iso : allen : that ' s really ticking us off and right now . . . enron : ryan : that to me signals , that ' s probably powerex , isn ' t it ? iso : allen : there ' s about four of them right now . enron : ryan : shit . iso : allen : and for the day - ahead for tomorrow , we didn ' t , we didn ' t , we took them out . basically , we ' re not allowing anything over the ties . enron : ryan : i didn ' t submit one for 17 or ? . iso : allen : that ' s fine . they ' ll probably go to a penny and they ' ll probably get excited and do a bunch , and we ' ll hopefully cut them off if you can get the next price and the next market at 80 or 91 . enron : ryan : okay . all right . well , i ' ll see what i can do . iso : allen : i appreciate it . it ' s actually in the best interest for the state and the iso [ with ] what these guys are doing , so we are trying to put a stop to it . enron : ryan : okay . iso : allen . thanks , bye . transcription of a telephone conversation between the iso ' s real time desk and enron ' s real time desk - july 3 , 2001 , 14 : 46 : 55 - 14 : 47 : 40 ( 3 minutes later ) enron : this is ryan . iso : hey ryan , its allen . enron : ryan : yeah . iso : allen : hey , did you put it in for the next hour ? enron : ryan : for hour 16 ? iso : allen : yeah , no , they already ran 17 . enron : ryan : oh , i didn ' t do 17 , no . iso : allen : well , see , we ' re gonna run , we ' re gonna run 18 coming up here in the next fifteen minutes . enron : ryan : okay . iso : allen : if you have any questions , let me know . i hope you know this is me from the iso . i don ' t know if you think i ' m somebody else but you can call me at the hour - ahead desk . enron : ryan : well , i mean , i ' m talking to my boss right now as far as , because of , you know , i don ' t want to be doing anything that ' s wrong . iso : allen : yeah ? enron : ryan : even if it is helping you guys out , if it ' s wrong , i can ' t do it . iso : allen : i know , but if you continue to bid in at , um , the market , that ' s the best thing to do . for replacement . all right . enron : ryan : okay , i ' ll see what i can do . iso : allen : thanks , man .

Subject: broker client deals louise , i don ' t think we have much value in assigning the broker client deals . most contracts have automatically terminated or have been terminated by the brokers on account of not having access to the submission screens . there is very little outstanding money left in these contracts , anyway - most of them have monthly payments and those which do not are paid to only ql 2002 , anyway . therefore , i think there is little value in pursuing assignment of these and i recommend we instead pursue new contracts ( at the appropriate time ) , perhaps with the first few months free to soothe any bad feelings on their part . do you agree ? dave summary of position :

Subject: please read sally , i tried to get on your calendar but you are busy this week so i decide to send you a very important e - mail . you told me to contact you if i was ever considering leaving my current job so i am doing so at this time . i want to say that i have thoroughly enjoyed working with you and you are the most impressive employee at enron at any level . i feel comfortable speaking with you and appreciate all of your advice . i am not totally unhappy with the recruiting part of my job , i just feel that i do not " buy into " everything that is happening in my group . there are many necessary changes that are needed and i feel that the program is heading in an excellent direction . i just want to get into more of a sales oriented part of enron because i feel that my strength is selling . i would like to at least get an interview with enron broadband because i know that they are filling up there retail sales groups . although i do not have all the technical experience , i know people who have gone over there with no technical or no sales experience . as you know , it is who you know and i do not have a relationship with david cox or any of the retail folks in broadband . i was hoping that you would give david a call and see if he could at least give me an interview in one of the retail groups . brent has called over to david and i feel if you were to call also , it would help . sally , let me know if this will be ok and i would like to get on your calendar to discuss further . nobody in my group knows that i am looking for another job so please keep this confidential . i can not tell how much i value your opinion and advice in matters especially like these . thank you so much and i look forward to hearing from you soon . george hope

Subject: kern river problems as was foretold by some of the kern expansion shippers , these shippers are justifiably angry about the way kern has sold capacity in their open season , particularly as concerns shippers ' access to markets on socal gas through wheeler ridge . however , what ' s even more encouraging here is to see that shippers are now validating the message tw embodied in its gir proposal - - new market entrants should only have secondary rights to socal system capacity in instances where there is a capacity shortage . shippers dispute kern ' s wheeler ridge sales chevron , amoco production , canwest gas supply , aera energy and rme petroleum have called on ferc to stop kern river gas transmission from overselling delivery point rights at wheeler ridge into the southern california gas co . distribution system . the firm shippers said in comments filed this week that , in a situation strangely similar to the recent el paso capacity reallocation case , kern river has oversold capacity at wheeler ridge , and its proposed expansion project will only exacerbate the situation ( docket cpol - 31 ) . on nov . 15 , 2000 , kern filed an application to expand its system and provide 74 , 500 dth / d of additional delivery point capacity at wheeler ridge into socal gas . but firm shippers claim recent data provided by kern and socal gas indicates kern river already has sold more than the 450 mmcf / d of firm delivery point capacity it has available into wheeler ridge . firm shippers told ferc . kern river has sold 468 . 4 mmcf / d of capacity at wheeler ridge . not true , says lynn dahlberg , kern ' s manager of marketing . " we have to date subscribed at 450 , 000 dth / d . and unless we subscribe at more than 830 , 000 dth / d , we have not sold more capacity than socal has takeaway . " the combined kern - mojave lines can deliver on a firm basis 600 , 000 dth / d , with kern having 450 , 00 and mojave 150 , 000 . " we can move more than that capacity , and we have , " she added . socal gas has noted that it curtails nominations from kern on a regular basis , shippers said . with the proposed expansion project , kern will be " creating the same type of firm delivery point over - sale situation that the commission found to be unjust and unreasonable on el paso natural gas at el paso ' s socal gas / topock delivery point , " they added . while they support the expansion , they do not want to see their firm delivery rights in southern california degraded . they also complained that kern ' s marketing affiliate is one of the primary beneficiaries of the proposed additional access to wheeler ridge . dahlberg conceded that other interstate lines also deliver to the wheeler ridge point , but " adding more players to wheeler gives markets on socal more supply options . shippers have to compete . " the shippers are concerned , however that " substantial benefits under the currently structured proposal accrue primarily to kern river and its affiliate and would restrict the firm rights of existing shippers . . . . " the commission should prohibit kern from selling additional firm rights at wheeler ridge , or provide only rights to secondary and tertiary capacity [ emphasis added ] that is of a lower priority than the rights of existing firm customers , they said .

Subject: re : corn subsidy govt program analysis vasant , thanks . let ' s contact wharton next week . vince from : vasant shanbhogue / enron @ enronxgate on 04 / 25 / 2001 10 : 15 am to : vince j kaminski / hou / ect @ ect cc : nelson neale / na / enron @ enron subject : corn subsidy govt program analysis hi vince , nelson and i had a meeting yesterday with the ag desk folks on how to go forward on the analysis and presentation for this program . the consensus from the ag side was that the choice of university will be highly politically driven , ie preferably the university should be from a state that has close ties to sympathetic senators or other political figures . also it is preferable if the university faculty have worked on ag issues before , lending more credibility in the ag community . the names that came up were mississippi state and texas a & m . nelson knows of a person at mississippi state who worked with the usda on risk management issues . the needed analysis itself is not necessarily very deep , and the focus is primarily to get a non - quantitative presentation out that outlines how enron can take on the downside risk of local crop prices ( enron probably needs to cover actual local prices and not simply an index because i do not think the govt will want to worry about basis risk ) . the pilot program itself will be very small , and lends itself to continuing down the path of short term trading rather than long term origination . another thought on hedging our potential short positon ( on the origination side ) is that the govt program can only provide a partial hedge to the extent of the premium received - - we still have unlimited downside from the short . vasant p . s . i am writing up jim bouillion ' s project suggestion as a potential project for wharton . of course , we may still ask wharton for their insights on the corn price protection approach .

Subject: california update - - 08 . 27 . 01 the california puc loretta lynch held a press conference in sacramento today to discuss changes to the commission ' s previously released proposal regarding direct access and the rate agreement between the puc and dwr . in the amended proposal discussed and distributed today , direct access would end retroactive to july 1 . customers with contracts executed as of july 1 would would remain direct access customers . the legislature the assembly version of the senate mou ( sb 78 ) has not yet been reviewed and voted on in the committee . it is scheduled to be reviewed and voted on at 6 : 30 pm pdt today . amendments on direct access were released this afternoon ( based on negotiations between davis ' office and business customers ) : customers who have consistently been da since may 2000 , including those " involuntarily " returned to bundled service , would be exempt from charges for edison ' s undercollection , dwr ' s forward contracts , and dwr - related exit fees , provided that the puc finds that no additional stranded costs are created for edison ' s remaining customers . customers who have consistently been on da between may 2000 and jan 17 , 2001 would be exempt from charges for edison ' s undercollection , dwr ' s forward contracts and dwr - realted exit fees , provided that the puc finds that no additional stranded costs are created for edison ' s remaining customers . customers who have been on da between jan 17 , 2001 and august 24 , 2001 would be exempt from exit fees related to dwr forward contracts , provided that the puc finds that no additional stranded costs are created for edison ' s remaining customers . customer ' s leaving after august 24 th would not qualify for exemptions . there is considerable work underway to make the august 24 th date the deadline for contract execution , rather than the date by which the customer must be dasr ' d , in order to qualify for the exemptions . direct access would not be suspended , however , until 90 days after the bill is signed by davis ( if he signs it ) , i . e . , the " effective date " of the bill . so anyone going to direct access between aug 24 and the effective date would not qualify for any exemptions . after the 90 - day period , da would be suspended until 1 . 1 . 03 . self - gen in service consistently from may 200 to august 24 would be exempt from edison ' s undercollection and dwr charges . self - gen that submitted an application to the energy commission by august 24 would be exempt from dwr charges beginning the date that the self - gen comes on line . self - gen that comes on line after august 24 would be exempt from dwr charges beginning the date that the self - gen comes on line , but the total number of exempt mws in this category would be limited to 250 mws per year , on a first - come - first - serve basis . at least 30 % of any increases in net short due to increases in demand would be reserved for self gen .

Subject: fw : ferc meeting summary fyi today ' s ferc meeting was a big deal . some of the key actions are : dstar and rto west are to be " married , " the ferc wants a single western rto but will wait on making caiso merge with other western rtos so that california can " heal its wounds . " every utility needs to declare which rto it plans to join by 12 / 1 / 01 ( or possibly 12 / 15 ; not sure of date ) . otherwise the utility will lose market - based rates , will be unable to get a merger approved , and will have its transmission rev req . scrutinized . the commission favors 1 market structure applied to the four nationwide rtos . it plans on holding a week of workshops and issuing a nopr to determine this structure . the goal is to essentially re - issue the order 888 tariff in a form that encompases the new functions of rtos . although consistent business rules applied to large geographic markets are a good thing , expect this new effort and redefining the rto to delay ultimate implementation . although california will be allowed to heal , it is ordering an operational audit of the calfornia iso . separately the ferc indicated the plan to issue a nopr on market power and market based rates . expect new rules and procedure to determine whether a market is sufficiently competitive to allow for market based rates . further summary , prepared by sarah novosel in our govt . affairs dc office , is provided bel o w the commission held its first open meeting with pat wood as the new chairman today and discussed many interesting issues . the following is a summary of the meeting . the meeting is still going on , and we will provide an addendum to this email updating you on what was discussed this afternoon ( regarding market power ) . rtos chairman wood expressed his desire to finish the rto transition , and that the commission needs to provide guidance and leadership in order to speed up the rto transition . chairman wood considers the rto effort on two tracks : 1 ) organizational - - what will the rto organizations look like , and 2 ) substantive - - once you set up the organizations , what will they do . organizational effort : wood stated that this effort has already begun with the july 12 orders and the northeast and southeast mediation efforts . the commission will be issuing additional orders in the northeast , southeast and midwest within the next couple of ferc meetings . wood also stated that it is time for rto west and desert star to " marry up , " meaning , i suppose , that the two should consolidate . wood does not think that california can be included in the western rto yet since it has lingering problems . structural effort : the commission will initiate a section 206 proceeding to address market design and structure issues in order to translate the 8 functions established in order no . 2000 into rto structures . to achieve this goal , the commission is establishing an " rto week " of advanced workshops , from october 15 - 19 , in advance of issuing a nopr , to address structural issues such as : congestion management ; cost recovery ; market monitoring ; transmission planning ; reliability ; transmission rights . wood also envisions that the commission will develop a new pro forma tariff to replace the existing order no . 888 transmission tariff . the new tariff will apply to all public utilities and rtos . wood also recognized that some " sticks " are needed to entice rto participation . therefore , wood proposes to have all public utilities come in by december 15 , 2001 with a declaration to join an rto . if they do not make this declaration , these entities will have their market based rate authority revoked on a prospective basis . furthermore , wood states that if entities do not join rtos , they should not be authorized to merge their facilities , and that ferc will also look at their rates to determine whether they are still just and reasonable rates compared with rates offered by rtos . wood states that these " sticks " provide incentive , but do not mandate , rto participation . with regard to the pending requests for rehearing , wood asked legal staff to figure out how " ferc can get there . " in other words , i think wood is telling them to develop the legal analysis for denying rehearing . while commissioner breathitt is skeptical about some of these rto proposals , because she was not required to vote on anything today , she only expressed her concern . upcoming dates october 15 - 19 - - rto workshops end of october - - further orders on northeast , southeast , midwest rtos december 15 , 2001 - - all public utilities must commit to an rto or have their market based rates revoked proposed rule for standards of conduct within the next few days , ferc will be issuing a notice of proposed rulemaking ( " nopr " ) on standards of conduct for transmission providers . as explained at the meeting ( we do not have a copy of the nopr yet ) , the nopr will propose to apply standards of conduct uniformly to electric transmission providers and gas pipeline transportation providers similarly . the nopr also proposes to broaden the definition of affiliate to include all energy affiliates , not just marketers . the standards of conduct would not apply to rtos and transmission providers who are members of an rto may ask for an exemption from the standards . the nopr will also likely include a proposal that the standards apply to transmission - owners ' marketing affiliates that are serving native load customers . as you know , the present standards do not apply to the affiliates of tos that are only buying and selling power for native load customers . as the interim general counsel noted , these marketing affiliates can go into the control room and have unrestricted interaction with the to . there was some discussion of whether it is necessary to apply the standards to affiliates serving native load . staff told the commissioners that market participants have been complaining for years about this loop hole in the rules . pat wood said they will include the proposal in the nopr ( breathitt may not support ) , but if the industry does not support the proposal , ferc will pull it . we of course will strongly support the proposal . provision of adequate electrical capacity ( icap ) chairman wood asked staff to prepare a presentation on reserves and installed capacity requirements . wood noted that the commission had to issue an order on icap in new england during their recess in august , and he is not that familiar with the issues . therefore , he asked staff to prepare a presentation , which they made at the meeting this morning . the presentation will be made public within the next couple of days . in sum , staff seems to believe that some type of icap requirement is needed for reliability . after the presentation , wood noted that the new england icap order has enough wiggle room to allow the commission to change its mind once the commissioners better understand the issue . wood sees that there is a potential conflict between decentralized , competitive markets and the need for sufficient supply ( without politically unacceptable , prolonged price spikes ) . commissioner brownell ( from the pennsylvania puc ) has a better understanding of icap and expressed concerns that icap may be an outdated tool that acts as a barrier to entry without any definable benefit to customers . realizing that there are many positions on this topic , chairman wood said he will publish the staff report and ask for comments by october 17 . we will definitely submit comments on this and will include everyone in the drafting process . sorry this is so long , but a lot happened today . we will provide a summary of the market power discussion as soon as it is over . let us know if you have any questions . sarah

( e . g . a 20 m / d package might involve a day bidding process , a 100 m / d block may involve a week posting ) . demonstrate that puts / calls don ' t undercut the release market . explain that release is used for day to day decisions , while we believe options will serve to help shippers with longer term strategic decision . be specific about any waivers of the part 284 regulations . work on the definition of the 4 options types . they stumbled over some of the wording , like the use of phrase " recall " in the transporter call . detailed notes we had a surprisingly positive reception from rates west . this could be due in part to mike coleman ' s reputed continued interest on the electric side and his self - proclaimed corporate bent . he did say that he understands the underlying business drivers for this program and suggested that a flushed out narrative with the filing to explain these would help our efforts . he said that the timing on this type of offering is good now , as the chairman is pressuring staff to improve the marketplace ( the california situation again ) . both groups suggested that we needed to lay out as much detail as possible in the filing , including examples of each type of options . as mike delineated and we expected , the major issues that may cause discomfort are affiliate abuse and capacity hoarding ( cornering the market under a long - term option ) or speculative capacity holding . to defend the service , we should lay out the impacts and explain why this offers an improvement over our present situation ( discounted firm ) . some specific questions from the rates group included : how does this impact capacity release how does tw protect against hoarding why aren ' t all options considered negotiated rates . are options tradable alone ( without capacity ) would the availability of options change the volume of capacity held by ena how are rofrs affected some specific questions from the policy group included : what are discriminating parameters / business decisions in allocating capacity how are competing offers allocated when in excess of available capacity how are options posted , bid on ? what are parameters of the options , specify range is it in the contract is this a physical or financial product does this verge into negotiated t & c territory ? is this like koch ' s option proposal ? ( no - koch offers an option on price only )

Subject: big cowboy - additional production tom did some footwork and questioning and determined where the additional big cowboy production is coming from . apparently , hpl cut a deal to purchase this gas at " hpl meters " at rocher and big cowboy # 2 , so the gas had been pathed on the gathering agreement into our pipe . all along , these volumes have been flowing into the gepl / big cowboy system and on to king ranch . tom and i spoke with clem about the most correct way to reflect the physical and determined that a transport usage ticket needed to be put into place , as im wellhead , to transfer the volumes from hpl to gepl and into the plant . we unpathed the gathering agreement and brokered the hpl purchase to the tu tickets and moved the gas on our transport on gepl to the plant , effective april 1 . this resolves our overproduction issues for april and forward . please let me know if you have any further questions , comments , or information to add . mary

Subject: wapa cut on 6 - 2 - 01 dear st _ sw traders , fyi - there was a cut on deal # 622350 . 1 on june 2 , 2001 for he 11 . it was a real time cut that reduced the schedule from 40 mw to 25 mw . mirant is at fault for the cut . ( our up - stream is pac ) . we originally thought that this got booked out between mirant and wapa , but when i spoke with kathy yesterday , she informed me that there was no bookout and that they want to cut the schedule . ( the people involved during the cut were geir at epmi , bob at pac , emily at mirant , and jackie for wapa ( jackie is a control area dispatcher , so she cannot do bookouts for wapa , hence there was no bookout ) ) . we have agreed that to cut the schedule will be the best for now . they do not plan on charging us ld ' s ( she ' s checking with her boss to make sure . ) we will just reduce the schedules to 25 for he 11 . it is up to you if you want to charge ld ' s to mirant for the spread . just wanted to let you know and get your input . virginia

Subject: suemar berryman ; gulf plains plant for current month daren , as you know , we have experienced some fluctuations at the berryman well for oct , which in turn affects our volumes at the gulf plains plant . from a physical standpoint , i think that we are fairly well balanced . my concern is that we are " overproduced " on paper by 76 , 162 dth / mo . i think that we need to bring the nominations up to balance in sitara at the berryman well and , a corresponding volume at meters 708 and 6363 , with an offset on strangers to keep the physical side in line . if my understanding is correct ( and if not , please correct me ) this should have a positive impact on our current month ua 4 . thank you , mary

Subject: fw : government affairs organization announcement fyi - - - - - original message - - - - - from : dernehl , ginger sent : friday , november 16 , 2001 2 : 45 pm to : shapiro , richard subject : government affairs organization announcement with the announcement of enron ' s acquisition by dynegy behind us , and with the initial severance process completed , it seemed an appropriate time to effect some organizational changes so that we as a group are better prepared to meet the challenges of the future . before i turn to the organizational changes , i would like to say a few words about those who will be leaving the company as a result of the initial severance ( you ' ll know who they are by their absence on the organizational chart ) : leading and being a part of this group has been a privilege ? i am thankful for every day that i have had that responsibility and thankful for however long i continue to have the responsibility . this sense of privilege and thankfulness is primarily driven by having had the opportunity to get to know and care about such a dedicated group of professionals and support staff and who , to a person , are also very decent and good people . to say good - bye to some of our colleagues is not easy . i want to , on behalf of all of us , thank them for their hard work , their integrity , their decency , and the good times and laughter that we shared . i trust that many of us will find ways to sustain friendships that have been and will continue to be very special . thanks to each of you who are leaving for all you have done . as to the organizational structure , it has become increasingly apparent to me that the existing organization , with a mix of groups organized along functional and regional lines ( particularly within the u . s . ) , has impeded our ability to get things done in the most efficient fashion at times . the need to rationalize the organizational structure , in order to consolidate all u . s . energy functions , is a strong need from my perspective . as a result , jim steffes will lead the u . s . energy group along with sue nord , who will jointly report to jim and myself . sue will assist jim in the leadership of the group and take on project management responsibilities as warranted to help jim shoulder a significant burden . also reporting to jim will be a leadership group for u . s . energy that will be as follows : wholesale electricity will be led by christi nicolay ; retail electricity and natural gas will be led by harry kingerski ; wholesale gas will be led by leslie lawner . last , but not least , jeff dasovich and sue mara , who will continue to focus on california energy issues , will report to jim . ( sue mara will also be part of the wholesale electricity team ) . steve montovano , who will continue to report to me , will lead a commercial development effort along with dan allegretti . with the elimination of the regional groups , i also recognize that there is a need to continue to focus on how we as a group address our political / legislative needs across the u . s . paul kaufman will lead a small group that will address that need and that will focus on state political support . paul will also take the lead for government affairs in support of corporate development efforts across the u . s . much of the rest of the group remains the same . linda robertson will continue to lead the washington group with sarah novosel , who reports to linda , taking the lead role in our coordination of activities at ferc . amr ibrahim will continue to lead the support of the global assets group and also continue to manage the risk analytics function . maggy huson will take over support of the non - energy business units , which are as follows : global markets , industrial markets , networks , and broadband . rob hemstock will continue to lead the support of enron canada . paul dawson , who heads up government affairs for europe ; sergio assad , who heads up government affairs for south america ; and mike grimes and mark crowther , who head up our asian efforts , will continue to jointly report to the business units and myself . i am also forming a north american leadership group for government affairs to provide policy guidance for the larger group and the company . that committee will consist of rob hemstock , maggy huson , amr ibrahim , paul kaufman , harry kingerski , leslie lawner , steve montovano , christi nicolay , sue nord , sarah novosel , linda robertson , jim steffes and myself . we will also continue to have an rcr committee that will consist of maggy huson , harry kingerski , sue nord , linda robertson , jim steffes & myself . finally , i am forming a dynegy / enron regulatory approvals working group that will consist of jose bestard , paul dawson , paul kaufman , sue nord , sarah novosel and myself . no organizational structure or set of organizational changes is either perfect or permanent . i believe these changes will make us better and more prepared for the future . however , we must be prepared to further adjust as the future unfolds for the company . one final note : i am deeply sorry that each of you has had to live through this uncertain and troubled period for the company . we are all saddened by the recognition that we are in the midst of changes that will leave our group fundamentally altered , but we must resolve to do our best for each other and ourselves during this period of change to ensure that what emerges , for those of us who do remain a part of the new dynegy , reflects the excellence and integrity that has characterized our group . personally , i will do all i can , for as long as i can , to steer the group through this to the very best place possible . your continued dedication and support is very much appreciated . hang in there and thanks .

" so said enron ceo ken lay in august , after his company ' s stock had fallen from over $ 80 to $ 36 since january , after the shocking resignation of his handpicked successor , jeff skilling , and after growing complaints about the company ' s incomprehensible financial statements . today there ' s mounting evidence that lay - - a senior statesman who helped create enron in the mid - ' 80 s - - may not be part of the solution . in the past two months enron ' s stock has sunk another 60 % , to $ 16 , amid concern that the company ' s murky disclosure may be a sign of deeper business problems . a conference call that lay held on oct . 23 , ostensibly to reassure skittish investors , was widely regarded as a disaster . enron " wiggled , squirmed , and gave a bunch of nonanswers , " as one listener puts it . even formerly docile sell - side analysts are turning hostile . after the call , prudential ' s carol coale downgraded enron to a sell , " not because of things that we know , but because of things that we potentially don ' t know . " enron ' s stock began its plunge in mid - october after the company announced its third - quarter results . as always , enron made its earnings number - - that is , before a gigantic , $ 1 . 01 billion charge due to a slew of investments gone sour . worse , enron was less than up - front about an additional $ 1 . 2 billion reduction in shareholders ' equity , caused by the early termination of controversial outside investment partnerships run by former enron cfo andy fastow . lay reassured investors that enron ' s credit rating was intact but made no mention of moody ' s , which after the call put enron ' s debt on review for a possible downgrade . as enron acknowledges , it is critical that the company ' s debt be rated investment - grade , given the requirements of its huge trading operations . enron ' s debt is currently rated several notches above investment - grade , and at the end of the second quarter the company had $ 12 billion in debt , or a not unhealthy debt - to - capitalization ratio of 46 % . but the most recent figures aren ' t yet available ( enron doesn ' t release a balance sheet with its earnings results ) , and there ' s concern about enron ' s ability to meet its near - term liquidity needs . the stock sank further when enron announced that the sec was inquiring into the fastow - run partnerships , which did a variety of bewildering deals with enron , raising questions about possible conflicts of interest . lay contends that the partnerships , named ljm and ljm 2 ( for fastow ' s children , says one analyst ) , were done merely to " mitigate volatility . " a so - called chinese wall - - meaning that enron and the partnerships were run as two separate businesses - - protected enron shareholders , he insisted . but here ' s an extraordinary line from one copy of ljm 2 ' s marketing material : " enron board of directors has waived ' code of conduct ' for a . fastow ' s activities relative to ljm 2 . " ( enron says it claims absolutely no responsibility for what may have been represented by an independent company . ) as for lay ' s assertion of a chinese wall , well , how can there be a chinese wall within fastow ' s brain ? on oct . 24 , enron announced a fall guy - - fastow would take a " leave of absence . " at the very least the partnerships demonstrate horrific judgment by people other than just fastow . enron ' s board , for example , gave its okay . one document shows that ben glisan , enron ' s treasurer , was also on the partnership ' s investment team . ( enron says that document is a draft . ) perhaps the biggest concern is the true profitability of enron ' s core business , its energy trading operation . the heart of the enron story , the stuff that captivated wall street , was the company ' s transformation from a stodgy gas pipeline into a technology phenomenon that could make a market in anything , from electricity to broadband . it ' s impossible to know if enron has used the partnerships and off - balance - sheet vehicles to influence its reported earnings . enron also mingles profits from asset sales with its trading income - - and despite its pledges , in the most recent quarter the company provided less , not more , disclosure on that front . in addition there are questions about how aggressively enron books trading - related revenue . in fact , a knowledgeable source at a competitor says that enron recognizes its revenues at two to five times the rate of that company ' s . if energy trading is really such a fabulous business for enron , why does it need to play so many games ? as for ken lay , who was once thought to be in jack welch ' s league , he has accomplished the truly remarkable feat of destroying much of what was left of enron ' s credibility in just a few short months - - along with some of his own . some observers suspect that the problem is not that lay is avoiding questions , but that he doesn ' t know the answers . in either case , lay is a long way from keeping his promises . quote : despite promises from ceo ken lay , enron ' s financial disclosure is still far from sufficient . color photo copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . editor ' s desk rik kirkland / managing editor 11 / 12 / 2001 fortune magazine time inc . 5 ( copyright 2001 ) the chitlin strut is about to crank up again in salley , s . c .

" yes , she argued . she was especially exercised about enron ' s opaque accounting and dubious rationalizations for its sky - high multiple . the stock was then at $ 75 , 13 of 18 analysts rated it a buy , and the company , which vigorously objected to bethany ' s piece , was still telling wall street it should be valued at $ 126 a share . eight months later , enron is trading around $ 15 , and that opaque accounting is a big part of its problem . see first for bethany ' s latest take on this ex - highflier . who is this guy ? i ' m not telling , because it would steal from the punch line of senior writer jerry useem ' s marvelous essay on leadership , " what it takes .

' s investigation of enron . but , speaking generally , mr . heine said the opening of a formal inquiry enabled the commission to subpoena documents and was used when s . e . c . staff members thought that the companies or executives were not responding voluntarily to their questions . if staff members ' ' run into situations where they feel they need information to look further and the sources for that information are not cooperative , the staff can go to the commission and recommend that the commission issue a formal order of investigation authorizing that the staff issue subpoenas , ' ' mr . heine said . when it disclosed the commission ' s informal inquiry on oct . 22 , enron promised to cooperate fully with the s . e . c . ' ' we welcome this request , ' ' kenneth l . lay , enron ' s chairman , said . a spokesman for enron did not return calls yesterday . enron began this year on an apparently unstoppable growth streak . but the company has suffered one setback after another . the company ' s efforts to become a profit - making water supplier and to create a new market in broadband communications capacity have been expensive failures . in august , jeffrey k . skilling resigned as chief executive , forcing mr . lay , his predecessor , to resume day - to - day control . enron ' s problems came to a head in mid - october , when it disclosed that its shareholders ' equity , a measure of the company ' s value , dropped $ 1 . 2 billion in the third quarter because of a deal with partnerships led by mr . fastow . because of complex accounting rules , the write - down was not apparent in enron ' s quarterly earnings report . news of the write - down disturbed investors because it suggested that enron might have found a way to hide losses , throwing the accuracy of its financial statements into question . last week , the company ousted mr . fastow , but it is now struggling to explain the transactions to its shareholders and bond - rating agencies . amid rumors that the company might face a cash squeeze , enron used a $ 3 . 3 billion line of credit last week and is seeking additional financing . still , some energy companies are shying away from making trades with enron that will take more than a few weeks to close . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . enron partnerships led by fastow face a formal sec investigation by john r . emshwiller and rebecca smith staff reporters of the wall street journal 11 / 01 / 2001 the wall street journal a 4 ( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones & company , inc . ) the securities and exchange commission elevated to a formal investigation its inquiry into enron corp . ' s financial dealings with partnerships headed by its former chief financial officer , andrew fastow . enron disclosed the sec action late yesterday . as a matter of policy , the sec doesn ' t comment on what it is or isn ' t investigating . a formal investigation involves the sec ' s enforcement branch going to the five - member commission and obtaining formal subpoena power to pursue its inquiry . a person familiar with the sec probe said the agency felt it needed subpoena power to compel the release of information by parties that have done business with enron . enron last week disclosed that the sec had contacted the company as part of what it described as an informal inquiry into the fastow - related partnerships . at the time , enron said it welcomed the inquiry and that it would cooperate fully with the sec - - a position the company has restated repeatedly since . while a formal order of investigation doesn ' t indicate that the sec has decided that there is wrongdoing , it is a sign " of a decision to pursue the investigation , " said former sec enforcement attorney jacob frenkel . " it clearly is one level up " from an informal inquiry , he said . as part of its efforts to deal with the overall situation , enron also announced the appointment of university of texas law - school dean william powers to its board . mr . powers will head a four - member board committee to look into the fastow - related transactions and other matters . former sec enforcement chief william mclucas , who is now with the washington d . c . law firm of wilmer , cutler paulo ferraz pereira , executive vice president of the brazilian - owned investment bank group bozano and herbert s . winokur , jr . , chairman and chief executive of capricorn holdings , inc . enron chairman and chief executive kenneth lay has asked the committee to " take a fresh look at these transactions and take any appropriate action , " the company spokeswoman said . enron has consistently said its dealings with the fastow - connected partnerships were legal and properly disclosed to investors . according to enron filings with the sec , the company did deals involving billions of dollars of assets and enron stock with entities related to the fastow partnerships . internal partnership documents indicate that mr . fastow and possibly others made millions of dollars from the partnerships . mr . fastow , who was replaced as chief financial officer last week , has consistently declined to be interviewed . news of the sec investigation came at the end of what lately had been a rare up day for enron in the stock market . after plummeting for 10 straight trading sessions , enron shares rose by nearly 25 % . in 4 p . m . new york stock exchange composite trading , enron rose $ 2 . 74 to $ 13 . 90 a share and was once again the big board ' s most active issue , with about 43 . 8 million shares changing hands . a little more than two weeks ago , enron shares were above $ 33 each . about a year ago they were around $ 85 . analysts and other observers said the rebound was partly due to bargain - hunting as well as continued speculation about a possible takeover bid for houston - based enron , given its current severely depressed stock price . starting about two weeks ago , enron suffered a sharp loss in investor confidence following big third - quarter write - downs , partly related to the fastow partnerships , and the disclosure of the sec inquiry . enron officials argue that investors have been overreacting and say the company is fundamentally sound . they have promised to be more forthcoming about the company ' s extremely complex finances . investors need to know more about the company ' s potential liabilities , said a . g . edwards analyst michael heim . " until you know the worst - case scenario , it is hard to move forward , " he said . to improve its liquidity , enron is nearing completion of a new bank credit line of roughly $ 1 billion to be secured by gas - pipeline assets , say people familiar with the matter . the new line would supplement existing credit facilities , which were largely used up last week when enron drew down about $ 3 billion to help it weather the current crisis . - - - jathon sapsford and michael schroeder contributed to this article . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . broadband trading ' s prospects narrow fast by elliot spagat staff reporter of the wall street journal 11 / 01 / 2001 the wall street journal cl ( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones & company , inc . ) create a market , and they will come ? last year , companies led by enron corp . envisioned a fast - growing , and very profitable , new market trading broadband capacity . as demand burgeoned for fiber - optic lines that carry internet and other data to offices and homes , they figured , people with too little or too much capacity would be eager to trade it - - much like soybeans , oil and electricity . but instead of a bustling market , it has pretty much been a bust , so far anyway . plummeting broadband prices , a dearth of creditworthy customers and now enron ' s financial woes have stalled the nascent market , and the costs are adding up . enron ' s broadband unit , for instance , had an $ 80 million operating loss in the third quarter on revenue of $ 4 million , down from revenue of $ 162 million a year earlier . the company also recorded a $ 180 million third - quarter charge to restructure its broadband unit , which included cutting 400 to 500 jobs and losses on the sale of inventory , and plans to close offices in london and singapore . enron handled just 405 trades in the third quarter , down from 759 in the second quarter . currently , the broadband market - - in which contracts to buy and sell capacity on fiber - optic networks are traded by brokers by telephone , rather than on the floor of a physical exchange - - records fewer than two dozen trades a day . many of the transactions take place between energy companies rather than between users and suppliers . that ' s less than what enron and others creating the new market , including dynegy corp . and el paso corp . , had expected . with characteristic bravado , they saw in telecommunications many of the same factors that drew them to gas and electricity : a newly deregulated market , plenty of inefficiency and what seemed to be insatiable demand for the fiber - optic lines to carry internet and other data . for example , if a big corporation needed to quickly expand its internal " intranet " service to send traffic among its various offices around the u . s . , it could in effect buy the capacity on the new market . after making hundreds of millions of dollars trading in natural gas and electricity , the companies were confident they could outmaneuver the giant telecom carriers , which never welcomed them , because the telecom companies wanted to control capacity rather than see it become a tradable commodity . " it ' s worked so well for us in gas , it ' s worked so well for us in power , " said stephen bergstrom , dynegy ' s president and chief operating officer . " there ' s a lot of differences , but there ' s also a lot of similarities . " the energy companies , nearly all of which are based in houston , saw the telecom industry as slow and secretive . telecom carriers typically spend six to nine months arranging multiyear deals to exchange network capacity or to serve major business customers . their contracts , which aren ' t disclosed publicly , often involve custom work - - for which they could charge premium prices . and if their service turns out to be unreliable , the buyer has little recourse . through trading of broadband capacity , enron in mid - 1999 saw the chance to offer telecom customers prices that were easy to understand and compare , because they would be based on standard contracts and instant delivery . penalties would be assessed when service faltered . contracts could change hands frequently and last for as little or as much time as the customers wanted . enron figured that time on fiber lines could be treated just like kilowatt hours of electricity . enron " kind of made it happen . the other energy players look like followers , " noted martin gray , vice president for trading and risk management at london ' s cable & wireless plc , one of the few telecom companies to take a serious interest in bandwidth trading . to back its efforts , enron erected an 18 , 000 - mile fiber network offering connections at blazing speed , and built 25 delivery points for companies to exchange bandwidth . it also relentlessly prodded carriers and large businesses to rethink the rules . but most telecom carriers never warmed to bandwidth trading . " houston is a bad word in their mind , " said jack blunt , senior vice president of finance at ratexchange corp . , a san francisco - based bandwidth broker that also operates a small electronic broadband - trading exchange . " the energy merchants are perceived as cutting in on their business and trying to create a commodities market . " efforts to create hubs , or points where service could be delivered , stumbled when other traders balked at how much information they would have to share if they used enron ' s sites . meanwhile , bandwidth prices were falling sharply , in part because telecom companies overbuilt their fiber - optic networks , and in part because demand , while growing , didn ' t grow as quickly as expected . as a result , customers were reluctant to buy contracts for fiber - optic capacity that would lock them into prices that might be much higher than rates they could get just a few months later . at the same time , upstart phone companies and internet service providers - - among the biggest potential clients for excess capacity traded on a broadband market - - were running into serious problems , reducing the number of creditworthy customers . el paso initially planned to invest $ 2 billion in its telecom business . a few months ago , it cut its projected investment to $ 1 . 5 billion . last week , the company said it would cut back " radically " and limit its focus to its existing network in texas and a delivery hub in chicago . " the clear line of sight to success has become very opaque , " said william wise , chief executive of the houston - based company . dynegy , which operates a 16 , 000 - mile fiber - optic network connecting 44 u . s . cities , reported a relatively moderate $ 15 million third - quarter loss in its telecom business . " we are not big on [ being ] first mover , " said mr . bergstrom . " we were second mover in gas , second mover in power , and we were second mover in telecom . " still , the houston crowd isn ' t giving up on the market . an enron spokeswoman said the company remains committed to telecom , but is reviewing costs . the company remains a chief cheerleader in trying to develop hubs and set standards . dynegy is " comfortable " with its current position , a spokeswoman said . chuck watson , its chief executive , said demand has picked up sharply since sept . 12 as companies have conducted more business by phone . he expects demand to grow substantially next year . but executives at several companies acknowledge that it may take months , if not years , to create an active trading market . if enron retreats further , the biggest winners would be the giant telecom carriers that considered enron a threat to their decades - old ways of doing business , analysts say . " all eyes are on enron , " said seth libby , an analyst at the yankee group research firm in boston . " when they came into this market , they were the catalyst , and they still are the catalyst to create bandwidth as a commodity .

" the situation is one where enron is likely to survive , but it is hard to analyse because we don ' t have all the information yet , " says john olson , vice - president of research at sanders morris harris , an investment banking firm . " with the stock being crunched so badly , only people with a high appetite for risk should buy . " that goes for acquirers as well , analysts say . the sec is conducting an unofficial enquiry into enron ' s financial dealings . andrew fastow , enron chief financial officer , has been replaced . shareholders have subsequently filed a series of lawsuits against enron . and not only has one of the main rating agencies downgraded enron ' s long - term debt , but the other two are reviewing it for potential downgrade . other outstanding issues include how much enron will get from the dollars 4 . 5 bn in asset sales it has been planning , including its dabhol power project in india , where enron and its foreign partners want to retrieve their dollars lbn in costs spent building the now - defunct plant . analysts warn there may be more losses to come at the company ' s poorly performing broadband division , where enron has warned it sees no immediate prospect of recovery , despite recent comments by dynegy , its rival , that the broadband market is improving . and there are worries enron may have to take extra charges on its other off - balance - sheet vehicles . kenneth lay , chief executive , has said the company is watching closely its operations in india , broadband and california , where enron is one of several energy traders facing questions over accusations of a manipulation of power prices - which it denies . but if enron had other impaired assets , it would have announced them , he added . the potential risks make it more likely , analysts say , that acquirers would rather buy one or more of enron ' s business units than the whole business . mr olson says enron ' s trading , outsourcing and pipeline businesses are all good growth businesses . the trading business , which has been growing 31 per cent a year , has been making a 23 per cent return on equity , he says . energy outsourcing , growing at 50 per cent a year , has roe of 62 per cent , and roe at pipelines , where growth has been 7 - 8 per cent a year , has been 24 per cent . at midday yesterday , enron ' s shares were trading at dollars 12 . 64 , up 13 . 26 per cent .

since its stock hit a zenith in january , the company has been in a downward spiral by laura goldberg and michael davis copyright 2001 houston chronicle for enron corp . , it ' s a long , long way back to late january , when houston ' s biggest company was flying high . jeff skilling , who played a central role in transforming enron from a pipeline company to a trader of everything from electricity to paper to the weather , was days away from taking over from ken lay as chief executive officer . the stock had acquired a high - tech gloss , as the world ' s largest energy trader had moved aggressively into the broadband business , where it hoped to profit from buying and selling space on high - speed data wires . today , the snapshot could scarcely be more different . enron ' s shares , which hit a closing high for the year of $ 82 in late january , have been trending downward since mid - february . they hit a nine - year closing low tuesday of $ 11 . 16 . skilling is gone , enron ' s credibility on wall street is in shambles , its broadband unit has been significantly scaled back , and there ' s speculation the company could be a takeover target . the securities and exchange commission is digging into business deals between enron and investment partnerships formerly run by its ousted chief financial officer . enron , which last week disclosed the sec had begun an informal inquiry into its affairs , said wednesday it ' s under formal investigation . the financial hits enron revealed earlier this month , related to the investment partnerships known as ljm cayman and ljm 2 co - investment , quickly triggered an expanding round of unanswered questions about enron ' s balance sheet and overall financial stability . a sharp decline in the stock price followed . investors and analysts , who are irked because they believe enron won ' t explain its complicated affairs , are painting their own worst - case scenarios . if enron doesn ' t move to calm investor fears , they could become a self - fulfilling prophecy , jeff dietert , an analyst with simmons could be sold off in pieces ; or is a bankruptcy candidate . analysts believe bankruptcy is unlikely . while enron may make an attractive acquisition target , a buyout offer is unlikely until the sec inquiry is resolved , they said . shares in enron closed up $ 2 . 74 to $ 13 . 90 wednesday , likely on takeover speculation and because it had been trading at such a cheap price . another possible outcome , said anatol feygin , an analyst with j . p . morgan securities in new york , would be another large player taking a minority stake as a strategic investment in enron , providing liquidity to shore up its balance sheet . at the moment , wall street is inclined to give lay some time to fix the problems .

" there ' s no request from the sec that we have failed to comply with , " enron spokeswoman karen denne said . " we ' ve cooperated voluntarily from the very beginning . " enron ' s board of directors also formed a special committee to investigate the transactions earlier this week and on wednesday named william powers , dean of the university of texas school of law in austin , to its board of directors to lead the special committee . the committee will serve as a primary contact between the company and the sec and will concurrently make its own detailed investigation . if needed , the committee has the power to take disciplinary action against any enron employee , officer or director who it determines " improperly participated in the transactions , " denne said . powers , a career academic , is known for his studies in product liability . he will be joined on the committee by board members frank savage , chief executive of savage holdings ; paulo ferraz pereira , executive vice president of brazilian - owned investment bank group bozano ; and herbert winokur jr . , chairman and chief executive of capricorn holdings . the committee has named william mclucas , the former director of the sec division of enforcement - - the group investigating enron - - as counsel . mclucas ' washington - based law firm , wilmer , cutler & pickering , retained deloitte & touche to provide independent accounting advice . the sec inquiry began shortly after oct . 16 , when steep losses in enron ' s third - quarter earnings drew renewed attention to a pair of investment partnerships created by then - chief financial officer andrew fastow . the partnerships , referred to as a form of off - balance sheet financing , were formed using enron equity and outside capital as a way to hedge against the risks involved in some of the company ' s new lines of business , such as internet broadband trading . fastow ' s dual roles as enron cfo and managing director of the entities were a cause for concern for wall street , which pressured fastow to cut ties with the outside partnerships in june . the company said it was careful to ensure that the interests of enron and its shareholders were protected , but when the partnerships accounted for significant losses for enron and a $ 1 . 2 billion loss in equity value , analysts began to demand more details . last week the company replaced fastow and began providing a few more details about its finances in order to maintain investor and client confidence . the company has declined to give out further information on the partnerships , however , because of the ongoing sec investigation . enron tapped a $ 3 . 3 billion line of revolving credit last week , putting about $ 1 . 1 billion in the bank to ensure it has cash on hand and using the balance to repurchase short - term debtinstruments . the company is expected to announce today or friday that it has lined up another $ 1 billion to $ 2 billion in credit from banks . financial enron discloses sec probe 11 / 01 / 2001 the washington post final eo 2 copyright 2001 , the washington post co . all rights reserved enron said the securities and exchange commission has opened a formal investigation into apparent conflicts of interest in dealings the company had with partnerships led by the company ' s former chief financial officer . the company also said it created a special committee headed by university of texas law school dean william powers to respond to the investigation . the committee has hired as counsel william r . mclucas , a former sec enforcement chief who is now a partner in the law firm wilmer , cutler & pickering . http : / / www . washingtonpost . com copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . enron corp . cut to near - term ` neutral ' at merrill 2001 - 11 - 01 07 : 43 ( new york ) princeton , new jersey , nov . 1 ( bloomberg data ) - - enron corp .

priority , ' ' said walker , who starts tomorrow as legal counsel to deutsche bank ag . the sec ' s decision follows months of investor demands that enron provide clearer financial reporting . lay promised more information about enron ' s complex transactions and earnings when he took over for jeff skilling , who resigned unexpectedly as chief executive officer in august after seven months on the job . failed investments after lay ' s promises , investors and analysts said they were caught off guard when enron reported a third - quarter loss of $ 618 million after writing off $ 1 . 01 billion in failed investments . of that , the company had $ 35 million in losses from dealings with ljm cayman and ljm 2 co - investment , two fastow - run partnerships . securing new bank loans became necessary after credit - rating companies said that enron was not providing enough detail about potential liabilities . moody ' s investors service downgraded enron ' s long - term debt this week , though it kept the company above investment grade . fitch has enron on watch for possible downgrade , and standard & poor ' s lowered enron ' s long - term credit outlook to negative . falling below investment grade would trigger agreements that would force enron to repay bonds sold by affiliated companies such as the ones created by fastow . enron has estimated its potential liability from such partnerships at about $ 3 billion . a lower credit rating also reduces the amount of cash that enron can raise to back its electricity , natural - gas and commodities trading operations . american electric power co . and exelon corp . officials said they lowered trading limits with the houston - based company or restricted their commerce to short - term deals concluding in november or december . off the books enron set up the fastow partnerships and other affiliated companies to buy enron power plants and other assets . by selling to the partnerships , which issued their own bonds , enron was able to get immediate cash rather than wait for an outside buyer , as well as move debt off its books . if affiliates can ' t generate enough money from the sale of assets , enron has agreed to make up the difference . enron also must buy out some investors if its stock and credit rating fall too low . three partnerships - - whitewing , osprey and marlin - - have about $ 3 . 3 billion in debt they plan to repay by selling power plants and related assets . mclucas is a partner in the law firm wilmer , cutler & pickering . he was director of the sec ' s division of enforcement for eight years , and he oversaw the $ 600 million fraud settlement with former junk -

per - share numbers to make it look as if things are better than they really are . usually , cost - cutting is the favorite technique - and there ' s certainly nothing wrong with that . but sometimes , desperate companies shunt unpleasant items aside under the rubric of special one - time charges , or point to murky " pro forma " results that don ' t include major liabilities . for proof of the potential unreliability of earnings numbers , take a look at what ' s going on at enron ( ene ) these days . in cases like this , the vaunted price / earnings ratio isn ' t always the best way to evaluate a stock . sales , on the other hand , rarely lie . companies can ' t do much tinkering with their revenue figures without raising eyebrows over at the securities and exchange commission . ( it is , after all , the top line on the earnings statement . ) if you want the straight scoop on a company ' s performance , revenues can sometimes be the best place to look . with that in mind , we turned to the price / sales ratio for this week ' s data mine . our basic premise was simple : a stock that trades at , say , 0 . 5 times revenues is cheaper than a stock that trades at 17 times revenues - and is thus more worthy of your attention . we also looked for companies whose p / s ratios are in the bottom half of their industry , where the real undervalued gems usually reside . and to make sure we didn ' t uncover total dogs , we insisted that our companies actually have earnings ( most dot - coms need not apply ) , that those earnings have grown over the past three years and that their stock prices have increased during the last year . ( you can access this recipe using our new screening tool . ) after all that , our universe of 7 , 498 stocks was winnowed down to just 38 . texaco also appeared , but since it recently merged with chevron to form chevrontexaco ( chv ) , we removed it . of these , 10 were electric and / or natural - gas utilities . in general , the outlook for that sector is wobbly . industrial demand for wholesale power remains weak , thanks to the slumping economy - meaning prices continue to slip from their recent highs . but the companies in the screen that have reported third - quarter earnings have shown steady revenue growth and solid earnings performance during this nasty economic slide . the utility with the smallest p / s ratio here ( 0 . 3 ) is wps resources ( wps ) , which serves customers in wisconsin and michigan . it reported third - quarter earnings of 76 cents a share on oct . 18 , beating the street by 14 cents . other notable utilities here include sempra energy ( sre ) and txu ( txu ) , two huge energy providers ( sempra primarily in southern california , txu mainly in texas ) that analysts believe may benefit from enron ' s recent problems . each has extended its presence in the energy - trading field enron pioneered and could pick up business in the u . s . and europe as a result . for more information and analysis of companies and mutual funds , visit smartmoney . com at http : / / www . smartmoney . com / . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . usa : enron trusts may prove troublesome if ratings cut . by dan wilchins 10 / 31 / 2001 reuters english news service ( c ) reuters limited 2001 . new york , oct 31 ( reuters ) - enron corp . thought it was making the right move in 1998 when it started yanking billions of dollars in assets off its balance sheet , but the transactions may come back to haunt the energy trading giant . if enron ' s credit rating falls to below investment grade , it could be forced to sell more stock . but paradoxically , one of the most likely reasons it would be downgraded is because of a long - term inability to sell stock in any form at a viable price . that would mean the largest trader of gas and power in north america could face a severe cash crunch when it would be least able to meet the crisis . while investors say the near - term outlook is not as bleak as a recent plunge in the company ' s share and bond prices suggests , default could occur if enron ' s credit - worthiness is cut to junk bond grade . with enron reportedly securing a roughly $ 1 . 2 billion credit facility and potentially a private equity investment recently , the chances of its being downgraded soon look more remote , said an industry analyst . however , " if enron gets downgraded , there could be serious trouble with the stock and these bonds , " noted an analyst . the potential avalanche of new shares would come from special financing vehicles the company used beginning in 1998 when it decided to focus on trading energy and de - emphasize businesses that require heavy capital spending , such as water utilities and power plant development . the company took several billion dollars worth of assets that it wanted to take off its balance sheet , and shoved them into several share trust structures , which sold debt and equity . the trusts , called marlin water trust ii , marlin water capital corp . ii , osprey trust and osprey i , inc . , issued about $ 3 . 4 billion in notes . intricate trust structures the trusts assured rating agencies the assets were at arm ' s length from the rest of the company , and would not drag down the rest of enron if they underperformed , said todd shipman , the lead ratings analyst on the credit at standard & poor ' s . but the intricate trust structures are hard for analysts to understand , and investor perceptions that enron has been less than forthright about its complex dealings contributed to the plunge in the company ' s securities . a securities and exchange commission probe into two enron partnerships with a former chief financial officer and an equity write - down also pushed securities lower . in the marlin and osprey trusts , enron essentially set up special companies that held physical and financial assets and then issued bonds backed by those assets . but in a sign of the difficulty in understanding their structure , one analyst said enron threw in preferred stock convertible into 50 million shares of common stock , while another analyst said the stock was 100 million shares . the structures , which also include about 40 million shares convertible into unregistered common stock , have a proviso to assure investors : the equity would be sold only if certain doomsday scenarios came to pass , and noteholders had legitimate reason to be concerned about getting paid back . one of the bleak scenarios included both enron ' s shares plummeting , and the company being downgraded to junk bond status by at least one rating agency . enron shares rebounded on wednesday after a 10 - day slide in which they lost more than 60 percent , meeting the stock plunge scenario . shares closed at $ 13 . 90 , recouping some of the lost ground over the past 10 days , when it traded at $ 33 . 84 . junk bond bound ? the scenarios seemed unlikely when the debt and equity was issued . " people thought the notes would be rolled over , or the assets in the trust would be sold , when the notes were originally issued , " said jim mcauliffe , a fixed - income analyst covering energy at morgan stanley in new york . on monday , moody ' s investors service cut enron ' s senior unsecured rating to two notches above junk bond grade , and put them on review for further downgrade . fitch said the company is on " rating watch negative , " and standard & poor ' s , which has enron a notch higher , has it on a negative outlook . " i don ' t consider a probability , " said s & p ' s shipman . for that to happen , enron would have to be frozen out of equity financing in any form for the long term , leaving it able to raise more capital only through debt . a downgrade to below investment grade would require that enron redeem the notes in short order , said an analyst familiar with them . analysts disagreed whether the convertible preferred stock would have to be sold in this case , but they agreed that it likely would be sold . " these structures did not anticipate that scenario , " said an industry analyst familiar with the structures . in addition to the possibility of default on these notes , enron ' s core business , energy trading and marketing would likely be hampered by a sub - investment grade rating , said shipman . counterparties would cut credit lines , demand more collateral be posted , and would likely demand more favorable prices . enron , however , appears to be sanguine about the trusts . although a spokesman from the company did not return calls for this story , enron told the wall street journal last week the company believes it can repay the principal on the notes without having to issue more stock . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . usa : update 3 - enron says sec inquiry now full - scale probe . 10 / 31 / 2001 reuters english news service ( c ) reuters limited 2001 . ( adds powers details paragraph 11 , minor changes throughout ) by jeff franks houston , oct 31 ( reuters ) - enron corp . , swept up in a deepening crisis , said on wednesday an informal inquiry by the u . s . securities and exchange commission had become a full - scale investigation of questionable financial dealings that have rocked the company in recent weeks and sent its stock plummeting . the nation ' s largest energy trader , scrambling to head off another shock to its already - shattered credibility , elected university of texas law school dean william powers to its board of directors , where he was to lead an internal inquiry into transactions that caused enron to take a $ 1 billion charge to third quarter earnings and name a new chief financial officer . the company said on oct . 22 the sec was looking into its finances , but stressed that the agency had only requested information . the disclosure that it was now a full - blown , formal investigation may indicate regulators did not like what they saw . before the announcement , which came after the stock market closed on wednesday , enron stock rose $ 2 . 74 to $ 13 . 90 to end a 10 - day tailspin that saw its price drop to nine - year lows while losing $ 17 billion in market value . analysts said bottom - fishing investors , along with speculation talk that enron may become a takeover target , had boosted shares . investors had been dumping enron shares following disclosures that the company did off - the - balance sheet transactions with two limited partnerships run by former cfo andrew fastow , who was replaced last week by another enron executive , jeff mcmahon . concern about possible conflicts of interest arising from the deals and the company ' s failure to explain them had dropped the stock to levels not seen since the early 1990 s , caused a downgrade in credit status , and brought the sec in . enron chairman and chief executive officer ken lay said the company was trying to shore up its credibility with the appointment of powers and the launching of an internal inquiry . " i have asked the board to take this action to address fully and forthrightly investors ' questions and concerns , " he said in a statement . " responding to the sec offers us an additional opportunity to achieve this same goal for investors and we will cooperate fully , " he said . the company said a committee led by powers would include several enron directors who do not work at the company and that it would have the power to " examine and take any appropriate actions with respect to transactions between enron and entities connected to related parties . " powers , a 1973 graduate of harvard law school , has been at the university of texas law school in austin since 1978 and was named dean in may 2000 . he is an expert in torts law and has written extensively on products liability . enron also said the committee hired william mclucas , a former head of the sec ' s division of enforcement , as its attorney . his firm , wilmer , cutler & pickering , has retained deloitte & touche to provide independent accounting advice , the company said . an sec spokesman would not comment on any aspect of the matter . enron was once a wall street darling touted by analysts and investors alike as one of the world ' s most innovative firms . a year ago , its profits and stock price were soaring as it transformed itself from a regulated natural gas pipeline company into a high tech wonder creating new internet - based markets in an assortment of commodities . but setbacks in broadband trading , overseas investments and the california power crisis took some of the shine off enron ' s star . in august , the financial world was stunned when chief executive jeff skilling resigned after just six months on the job , saying he wanted a lifestyle change . investors who thought enron could do no wrong turned on the company , complaining that its financial statements were incomprehensible and its management unresponsive . the capper came two weeks ago when enron said that , along with the $ 1 billion charge against its earnings , it also had cut shareholder equity by $ 1 . 2 billion because of the curious transactions with the fastow - led entities . fastow has denied any wrongdoing , but has been unable to say much because of the sec probe and a growing number of shareholder lawsuits against enron . to assure the financial world that it had plenty of cash , enron tapped into a $ 3 . 3 billion credit line last week . but on monday , moody ' s investors service dealt the company a blow by cutting its credit rating to two notches above junk bond status . it warned further cuts were possible . analysts said it was imperative that enron fully explain the transactions that led to its fall from grace and disclose whatever liabilities they may have caused . " enron needs to substantially improve the level of disclosures , " said nitin khandkar , a portfolio manager with dubai - based al majid investment co . , which owns enron stock . " the accounting policies it follows should not be merely legal but should also reflect the company ' s true profitability . " " people are still struggling with trying to quantify what the worst - case scenario could be , " said mike heim , an analyst with a . g . edwards & sons . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . usa : funds still shying away from former darling enron . by judith crosson 10 / 31 / 2001 reuters english news service ( c ) reuters limited 2001 . denver , oct 31 ( reuters ) - despite bargain prices , mutual fund managers are not rushing to buy shares in enron corp . , the once high - flying energy stock struggling under a blizzard of bad news including a formal sec probe into some of its deals . fears of a credit crunch , murky business dealings and the sec probe are keeping potential buyers wary , although the stock rose 24 . 5 percent or $ 2 . 74 on wednesday to close at $ 13 . 90 , its first rise after 10 straight days of losses . " the book value is around $ 11 . 40 a share . that ' s why you ' re seeing buying today , " said rahim kassim - lakha , portfolio manager of us global investors ' global resources fund . on tuesday enron shares fell 19 percent to their lowest level in nine years . kassim - lakha ' s fund has only a small holding in enron . " we actually have been selling the stock . we ' ve sold as high as $ 60 . we ' ve kept a very , very small position to maintain an interest in the company , " he said . " we are not in any way overexposed to this stock , " he added . but the big question is what other problems are on the horizon for enron , once the darling of wall street . the stock has been widely held by institutions , teachers ' retirement funds and mutual funds . at the end of june nearly 70 percent of its shares were in the hands of 1 , 175 institutions , according to data compiled by thomson financial ' s sharewatch . firstcall . enron said wednesday that it has appointed a special committee to examine its finances and communicate with the securities and exchange commission , which upgraded its informal inquiry into the company ' s finances to a formal investigation . the sec is investigating " certain of the matters that were the subject of recent press reports , " the company said in a statement . that was a reference to reports of murky off - balance - sheet deals with partnerships run by the company ' s former chief financial officer , andrew fastow . questions persist portfolio manager kassim - lakha said he still wants to know more about why chief executive officer jeff skilling abruptly left in august , more details about why fastow had to vacate his duties and what the company plans to do to rekindle investor confidence . " maybe they need extra help or a team to come in and tell them what ' s best to do , " he added . the company said about two weeks ago there were off - balance - sheet deals with partnerships run by fastow , prompting the sec to launch a conflict - of - interest inquiry . skilling left in august after six months on the job , saying he wanted a change in lifestyle . a company spokesman on tuesday said enron has pledged to restore investor confidence . rick giesen , who managers the munder power plus fund and who shed his enron position at the low $ 30 , also said he felt there were too many uncertainties to warrant a buy yet . " we still can ' t quantify the maximum exposure here from a market standpoint , " he said . at one point giesen thought the stock might be a good buy around $ 25 , but was dissuaded by all the unanswered questions surrounding the company . " a lot of things need to run their course before you can make a reasonable assessment of the upside potential against the downside risk , " he said . giesen said enron could be hit by shareholder lawsuits and the company , the biggest energy trader in north america , could see its volume decline . " people might not want to be the counter - party to enron ' s trades , " he said . market watchers are keeping an eye on some big funds like janus corp . , the biggest holder of enron with 42 . 8 million shares in its stable , according to data reported at the end of june . a janus capitol corp . spokesman said the denver - based fund does not comment specifically on holdings , but spokeswoman shelly peterson added : " by simply looking at our june 30 th filing it would be inappropriate to assume that that ' s our position today .

" the number of class members will be huge , " says maurice pesso , a lawyer at a new york firm that has filed a claim . there are , however , limits to the company ' s liability . it has already restated its results going back five years , but federal law restricts litigation to the past three . moreover , enron will not take the rap alone . its auditor , arthur andersen ( now plain andersen ) , is also named as a defendant in at least one of the complaints already filed . the litigation comes after a rough decade for andersen . it has had to pay hundreds of millions of dollars in settlements after sloppy audits on such companies as waste management , sunbeam and discovery zone . because enron evolved from an energy company into a financial firm , it became much like an unregulated bank . the lack of supervision meant that the role of the company ' s auditor was crucial . andersen was certainly paid as if it was . in 2000 , it collected $ 25 m for auditing enron ' s books and another $ 27 m for consulting services . now how do you account for that ? copyright ? 2000 dow jones section c did ken lay understand what was happening at enron ? by floyd norris 11 / 16 / 2001 the new york times page 1 , column 2 c . 2001 new york times company what a tangled web was weaved by enron . both investors and managers seem to have been misled . ' ' enron became overleveraged , ' ' kenneth l . lay , enron ' s chairman and chief executive , said this week , adding that things went wrong in ways that ' ' i could not have ever contemplated . ' ' he pointed to investments that ' ' performed far worse than we ever could have imagined . ' ' that was the first time that enron had admitted it had a leverage problem , and it came only after the brutal reality had become apparent to many others . mr . lay says he understood what was going on , but i suspect he had left crucial details to others who have since departed and did not fully grasp the reality that was obscured by enron ' s soothing financial statements . when enron was riding high , it could easily have sold stock to raise capital that it now desperately wants . mr . lay and other executives sold stock , but the company did not . just a month ago , mr . lay spoke enthusiastically of how great the company ' s continuing earnings were . the leverage was not easy to find . a lot of it was carried off enron ' s balance sheet . partnerships and special - purpose entities that enron set up borrowed money and funneled the cash to enron . enron guaranteed the debt but did not have to show it on its own balance sheet because it could meet its obligations by issuing stock . as undisclosed losses built up in those entities , it became more likely they could not pay their bills , leaving enron to do so . it is also clear that the bond rating agencies did not understand enron ' s plight until the last couple of weeks . when they figured it out , it took a $ 1 . 5 billion equity infusion that is part of the dynegy takeover to keep enron ' s rating above junk level . now enron has a board committee investigating various transactions , and promises to release details as they are uncovered . officials speak as if they are learning what happened for the first time , and perhaps they are . jeffrey skilling , mr . lay ' s protege , was enron ' s chief financial engineer until he quit this summer . and enron ' s chief financial officer and treasurer were ousted as enron unraveled . some investors would say none of that matters now , that the only important fact is that dynegy is buying enron anyway . chuck watson , dynegy ' s chief executive , is convinced that enron ' s energy trading business is a gem that more than justifies the price dynegy is paying . he figures the losses from the bad investments can be contained . the big question now may be whether mr . watson will retain his enthusiasm after his people study enron ' s trading positions . enron has always said it hedged its big derivative positions - - positions that can contain huge leverage that does not show up on the balance sheet - - but some of that hedging was with affiliated companies . if big surprises are found , dynegy could back out of the deal . there is plenty of blame to go around here , and suits have been filed against enron , its current and former officials , and its auditor , arthur andersen . but investors also bear responsibility . enron ' s financial statements were , as mr . lay conceded this week , ' ' opaque and difficult to understand . ' ' investors and analysts knew they did not know what was going on . they bought anyway . enron was viewed as a company that always made its numbers . an old - line gas pipeline company had been transformed into a brilliant trader that could apply its magic around the world . investors did not care how enron made the numbers . now , when it is too late , they do . graph tracks the monthly closes of enron ' s stock price from 1998 through 2001 . yesterday ' s close : $ 9 . 48 copyright ? 2000 dow jones section a a quick change in fortune dulls the glimmer of houston by jim yardley 11 / 16 / 2001 the new york times page 14 , column 1 c . 2001 new york times company houston , nov . 15 - - on a day when oil prices plunged to two - year lows , when the hometown enron corporation continued its ugly free fall and when gloomy projections showed the local economy headed for a decidedly rough patch , george alcorn lunched on chilean sea bass at the downtown petroleum club and decided that the sky was not falling . ' ' i ' ve been an optimist all my life , ' ' said mr . alcorn , 69 , who owns an independent exploration company and survived the oil bust years of the mid - 1980 ' s . ' ' the opportunities in this town have always been large . i don ' t think it ' s going to change at all . ' ' that mr . alcorn could sound upbeat in such seemingly grim economic times is hardly surprising in a city largely built on pluck and buoyant optimism . until recently , economists had predicted that the economic downturn plaguing the rest of the nation would largely bypass houston , the nation ' s energy capital . in june , the economist magazine , citing houston ' s increasingly diverse economy , even promoted it as a candidate for the world ' s next great international city and business center . but june is a long time ago . by then , the city had already lost 2 , 000 jobs from the struggling computer maker compaq and will probably now lose thousands more if the company ' s merger with hewlett - packard is approved . in the aftermath of the sept . 11 terrorist attacks , continental airlines , which is based here , announced 12 , 000 layoffs , some likely to come in houston . the texas medical center , one of the largest medical complexes in the world , is facing financial peril after flooding in june caused an estimated $ 2 billion in damages . the latest blow to the economy as well as the local psyche is the plight of enron , the energy company that some analysts said tottered near bankruptcy before a merger with its local rival , dynegy , was announced last week . even if the merger goes through , the city is expected to feel a crunch ; local real estate analysts say the merger could produce a glut of downtown office space at a time when new towers are under construction , including one by enron . one visible symbol of the changing fortunes is that two of the city ' s sports stadiums , enron field and compaq center , are named for companies that soon may not exist . this week , the national association of purchasing management , which measures business activity and industrial production , released a report showing that houston ' s economy had contracted in october after 32 consecutive months of expansion . ' ' over the first half of this year , you had to feel pretty good , ' ' said bill gilmer , an economist at the federal reserve bank of dallas and an authority on houston . but mr . gilmer said that much of the city ' s recent job growth was driven by oil and gas companies and that the decline in prices meant the sector was ' ' running out of steam . ' ' ' ' the national economy , ' ' mr . gilmer added , ' ' is not helping out right now . ' ' the fact that the ailing national economy is dragging on houston is , oddly enough , evidence of the city ' s success in recovering from the 1980 ' s oil bust . then , with the local economy dominated by oil and gas , the drop in prices crushed the city and prompted civic leaders to preach economic diversification . and it worked : compaq , continental , the texas medical center as well as dramatic growth in small business helped houston recover and grow even faster , becoming the nation ' s fourth - largest city . the new generation of sophisticated energy companies , led by enron , then created a boom . economists say the next several months are likely to be slow . there could be substantial layoffs if compaq and enron mergers take place . mr . gilmer said the price of oil still played a large role in the city ' s economy ; the number of exploration rigs has dropped to roughly 1 , 000 from about 1 , 300 in recent months . yet no one is predicting a reprise of the bust , when downtown office buildings stood practically empty . instead , economists point to a relatively quick rebound . ray perryman , a texas economist who runs the perryman group , said houston still had an infrastructure envied by most other cities , including the city ' s bustling port , the nation ' s second largest . the city was recently named as one of four finalists to become the american entry to be host of the 2012 olympic games . voters recently approved construction of a starter light rail line , and federal environmental officials recently signed off on a plan to greatly reduce air pollution . ' ' we ' re sitting here with over two million jobs , ' ' said former mayor bob lanier . the downfall of enron , though , a company whose value dropped almost 90 percent because of accounting problems and financial distress , has been the most highly publicized and unexpected blow to the city ' s economy . the company had embodied the self - image that houston business leaders hold dear : it was entrepreneurial , aggressive and ground breaking . it was also a generous civic benefactor ; the company ' s chairman , kenneth l . lay , a close friend of president bush , had even been rumored as a potential mayoral candidate . but this week , enron ' s lost glory became painfully evident . in a hall at rice university on tuesday , mr . lay presented alan greenspan , the federal reserve chairman , with a lifetime achievement award , the enron prize , which mr . lay ' s company had endowed and named in flush times . the next morning , an article in the houston chronicle said no decision had been made on whether the name of the prize would be changed . photos : compaq center , home of the n . b . a . houston rockets , is named for a company that soon may not exist . enron , above , may soon be acquired by a rival energy company .

( operating cash flow at cablevision is defined as operating profit before depreciation and amortization . ) insurance will cover some of the cost of the johnson - longley payouts . ' ' the team looks healthy , ' ' jim dolan , the president of cablevision , said on tuesday during a conference call with analysts . ' ' i don ' t expect any more write - offs . ' ' whether that turns out to be true depends on whether any currently hearty player sustains a career - ending injury . but cablevision could have avoided this financial circumstance had it paid attention to the physical conditions of johnson and longley . in each case , the garden knew it was acquiring damaged goods . in his second season in charlotte , johnson hurt his back , and he has never been the same . maybe the garden was swayed that he was well enough , because he averaged 20 . 5 points and 8 . 4 rebounds in the season before it traded anthony mason for him . but the persistence of his back problems in the last few seasons attests to the riskiness of getting him in the first place . the back compromised his skills , often limiting him to being a symbol of the knicks ' grit . he also spelled ' ' l ' ' with his bended arm quite nicely , yet not worth an average of $ 7 million a year . when longley arrived from phoenix last year in the four - team deal that sent patrick ewing to seattle , he said he had told the knicks that he had a degenerative ankle condition . ' ' i brought up my ankle in my physical with the knicks , ' ' he said in july , ' ' and they said , ' have you been playing ? ' i said , ' yes , ' and that was it . ' ' the fact was , he played for the australian olympic team in sydney last year , but pain from his ankle kept him from practicing . should have been a tip - off . the naming rights dance enron field , home of the houston home run , is bound to be called something different next season when jimy williams starts his tenure as the astros ' manager . enron , the world ' s largest energy trader , agreed to pay $ 100 million to put its name on the ballpark for 30 years , a deal that began last year . but enron is in trouble . it has lost nearly $ 60 billion in its market value ; the company recently said it had overstated its profits for the past five years by nearly $ 600 million and it agreed to be acquired by dynergy for $ 9 billion . in another part of houston , the compaq center could take on another name now that the computer maker it was named for in 1997 ( at $ 900 , 000 annually for six years ) is planning to merge with hewlett - packard . in 2003 , the rockets will move to a new arena . named stadiums and arenas have changed monikers before . a takeover turned philadelphia ' s comcast center into the first union center . the twa dome in st . louis is now the dome at america ' s center to reflect twa ' s purchase by american airlines . marine midland arena in buffalo now has hsbc ' s name . meanwhile , pro player stadium near miami is named for a defunct division of the bankrupt fruit of the loom . two other n . f . l . stadiums , one being built , the other three years old , are named for ailing companies . in foxboro , mass . , cmgi field is being readied for play next season by the new england patriots . in the 12 months ended july 31 , cmgi , an internet development company , lost $ 4 . 4 billion ( twice the annual network tv payments to the n . f . l . ) . cmgi will pay $ 114 million over 15 years for its naming deal - - if it lasts that long . psinet , an internet communications services provider that is paying $ 105 . 5 million over 20 years to be the name atop the baltimore ravens ' stadium , filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection earlier this year after losing $ 3 . 2 billion in the quarter ending march 31 . the conseco fieldhouse in indiana , the home of the pacers , is named for a finance and insurance company that recently posted a $ 410 million quarterly loss . the financial state of some airlines since sept . 11 may affect some of the arenas and stadiums named for them . besides the dome in st . louis , six other facilities are named for airlines ( two for american ) . last year , the canadian airlines saddledome , where the calgary flames play , changed its name when its namesake went bankrupt and was bought by air canada . now it is the pengrowth saddledome . copyright ? 2000 dow jones fleeing investors have bid the stock down about 90 % from its high last fall . 4 . a blodget blunder ? speaking of folks who lost money for investors , analyst henry blodget is taking part in a buyout at merrill lynch , reportedly exiting the firm with a severance package of about $ 2 million .

( ap ) - employees of portland general electric are in shock after watching their retirement savings dry up along with the stock of energy giant enron , pge ' s parent company . the sting isn ' t helped by the fact that the selloff coincided with a lockdown that forced employees to hold the stock in their 401 ( k ) retirement plans . stock prices have plummeted more than 70 percent since oct . 16 , when enron announced a $ 618 million third - quarter loss . the loss stemmed largely from investment write - offs that led to the dismissal of the company ' s chief financial officer and now are being investigated by the securities and exchange commission . on oct . 17 , houston - based enron " locked down " the 401 ( k ) accounts , meaning employees were not allowed to sell their enron stock or make any other changes to their plans . the freeze lasted until wednesday . peggy fowler , pge chief executive officer , said the lockdown was the result of a long - planned change in retirement fund managers and acknowledged that " the timing couldn ' t have been worse . " for 2 , 700 pge employees with enron 401 ( k ) plans , the slump has decimated their nest eggs . " we couldn ' t get out , we just sat there and watched our nest eggs go down to nothing , " said roy rinard , a pge lineman from boring with all of his 401 ( k ) plan in enron stock . rinard , 54 , said his account has dropped in value from more than $ 472 , 000 a year ago to $ 238 , 000 at the time of the freeze to about $ 70 , 000 now . " i just feel like i ' ve been stolen from and lied to , " said alan kaseweter , 43 , a pge service department employee who had almost all of his 401 ( k ) invested in enron stock . kaseweter , of redlands , said his account has dwindled from $ 348 , 000 a year ago to $ 115 , 500 at the time of the freeze to $ 36 , 000 . enron and pge employees must accept enron stock as the company ' s matching contribution to their 401 ( k ) accounts . only employees over 50 and retirees are allowed to roll it over to another investment . enron seemed like a good bet . the stock climbed 475 percent between 1995 and dec . 31 , 2000 . enron purchased pge in 1997 , while it was reinventing itself into a cutting - edge energy trading company . it took staple products such as natural gas and electricity and attempted to trade them like other commodities . reports surfaced about partnerships founded by enron chief financial officer andrew fastow . the partnerships borrowed money on enron ' s behalf , which allowed enron to keep the debt off its books . fastow left the company , and the u . s . securities and exchange commission opened an investigation . on nov . 8 , enron said it was restating earnings for the past five years , in effect admitting that it had inflated profits . at the same time , enron froze employees ' 401 ( k ) accounts . enron decided in july that it would hire new administrators for the retirement program . the changeover required about a month . enron directors and executives dumped stock through much of the past 12 months , selling more than $ 136 million worth in all - a fact prominently mentioned in recent shareholder lawsuits against the company . investors have also filed five lawsuits against enron ' s executives and directors , including former pge chief executive kenneth l . harrison . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . city - international power looks for purchases . by roland gribben . 11 / 16 / 2001 the daily telegraph p 36 ( c ) telegraph group limited , london , 2001 international power , the electricity generator spun off after last year ' s break - up of national power , yesterday signalled it was limbering up for a fresh round of acquisitions . a number of companies in the markets where international operates are putting assets up for sale amid uncertainties about the power and financial outlook . international is also keeping a close watch on developments at enron , the american power generator and major market trader , in the throes of being rescued by rival dynegy . phil cox , finance director , said : " there are more opportunities opening up and we are looking at them . our balance sheet is strong enough to accommodate the best of them .

" calgary - - six powerhouse u . s . players are joining transcanada pipelines ltd . and westcoast energy inc . in an attempt to inject new momentum into a bid to build a multibillion - dollar pipeline from alaska . the partnership , which includes energy services and transportation giants williams cos . , duke energy corp . , enron corp . , as well as major utilities el paso corp . , pg & e corp . and sempra energy utilities ventures , have agreed to work together with transcanada and westcoast to put a proposal before the alaska gas producers before the end of the year . the group , which laid out its intentions in a memorandum of understanding signed yesterday , said they believe a gas pipeline running along the alaska highway can be built by 2008 . murray birch , senior vice - president of westcoast , said the partners lend expertise , deep pockets and scale to the mammoth project , which is estimated to cost well over $ 10 - billion ( u . s . ) . " it ' s in our best interest to involve them . this project is a large project , and certainly westcoast and transcanada would have been stretched to do it by ourselves , " said mr . birch , who is also the co - chief executive officer of foothills pipe lines ltd . a joint venture co - owned by westcoast and transcanada . foothills holds the regulatory permits to the proposed alaska highway pipeline . mr . birch said the equity position of each company in the project is still to be worked out . rocco cianco , a foothills spokesman , said that is in part because some of the companies are in a state of flux . westcoast is in the process of being taken over by duke , while houston - based enron is in the process of being bought by hometown rival dynegy corp . the partnership brings back to the table all nine of the original participants in a similar pipeline project that was proposed in the 1970 s and shelved because of weakening commodity prices and native opposition . mr . birch noted that it also removes a legal question hanging over the pipeline project , of whether the six u . s . companies had any claim on the project based on their capital investment in the 1970 s project . they withdrew from that project on the understanding that if it was to restart , they would be able to recover that initial investment , which some have pegged at up to $ 4 - billion including interest , he said . in getting back on board , the six companies have agreed to waive that claim , he said . scott kent , the minister of economic development for yukon , a vocal proponent of the proposed pipeline , said the removal of the legal question lifts a huge barrier to the project . " there was a chance this could have ended up in a lengthy court battle that would have significantly hampered " the project , he said . " it ' s certainly very good news . " winfried fruehauf , an analyst at national bank financial in toronto , said the six u . s . companies as well as westcoast , transcanada and foothills are trying to make sure they ' re first in line to move the gas from burgeoning alaskan fields to market . " everybody and his and her uncle wants to be in this pipeline , there ' s so many ' me toos ' that they just want to position themselves , " he said . the market understanding is that the alaska producers , which include exxon mobil corp . , phillips petroleum co . , bp amoco plc and chevron corp . , will ultimately decide who will build and operate a pipeline because the cost of such a project would be recovered from them in the form of pipeline tolls . gina taylor , a spokeswoman for enron , said the partners got together with an eye on approaching producers to get an answer from them on whether the project can go ahead . " marketplace approval is key to us moving forward with this , " she said . " that ' s why we put the [ memorandum ] in place , so we could go out and revisit with the producers . " but curtis thayer , a spokesman for the alaska producers , said it is too early to talk about who will build or operate the pipeline , because his group has not even decided to proceed with one yet . he noted that a preliminary analysis done as part of a $ 100 - million study the group has undertaken indicates a pipeline couldn ' t pay for itself at current commodity prices . however , no decision has been made , he insisted . some of the other options floated include building a pipeline off the north shore of alaska and yukon to gas fields in the northwest territories , then down the mackenzie valley of the nwt , or a pipeline going over land in yukon to the nwt . there are various backers for each proposal and the alaskan producers have not ruled out undertaking a project themselves . joe handley , the minister of finance for the nwt , said news of the partnership is a spur to participants in the proposed mackenzie valley pipeline . the territory ' s government has consistently said an nwt pipeline must be built first or risk being derailed by an alaska pipeline that would flood the market with product . " if we don ' t keep on our toes , [ an alaska pipeline ] could pass us and leave us in the bush , " he said . foothills announced earlier this week that it reached a preliminary agreement with the kaska nation , removing another potential hurdle to the alaska pipeline proposal . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . nov . 16 , 2001 houston chronicle new power faults data flow but opposes program delay by laura goldberg copyright 2001 houston chronicle the new power co . , a major player in the state ' s test pilot of electricity deregulation , said thursday that problems getting data from other entities have caused it to send out customer bills late and without all the appropriate charges . but new power , an electricity provider , is hopeful problems can be resolved and doesn ' t believe the state should delay the planned jan . 1 start of electricity deregulation . delays and computer glitches have plagued the pilot program , which let a limited number of consumers across the state choose power providers before the opening of the full market . new power and other electricity companies made comments thursday in filings with the public utility commission . the puc will use them as it evaluates whether to move forward on jan . 1 . several other companies also cited some ongoing problems . new power , which enrolled more than 61 , 000 customers in the pilot , said a majority of its customers are getting late bills and that it has issued initial customer bills for lower amounts than what ' s due . before new power can issue accurate bills , it needs information from separate companies that maintain electricity transmission and metering systems . that information is sent to new power through the electric reliability council of texas , which runs a variety of computer systems need for deregulation . a new power spokeswoman said executives have met with the companies and ercot about the problem and the situation seems to be improving . reliant resources , the houston parent of electricity provider reliant energy retail services , said in its filing that it is " confident that any remaining significant issues will be overcome " in time to open the market jan . 1 . near the end of last month , nine retail electricity providers told the puc they opposed delaying the planned start date of deregulation . a coalition of consumer groups has called for a delay , saying the state isn ' t ready for a variety of reasons . but the electricity companies , which included reliant and new power , said the market shortcomings the consumer groups cited either don ' t exist or can be fixed and don ' t require a delay . consortium ' s return sparks renewed hope in gas pipeline project by mike chambers associated press writer 11 / 15 / 2001 associated press newswires copyright 2001 . the associated press . all rights reserved . juneau ( ap ) - a natural gas consortium plans to resurrect its proposal to build a 1 , 700 - mile gas pipeline through alaska to the lower 48 , sparking renewed hope in the massive undertaking just as oil companies were doubting its viability . the nine american and canadian companies announced plans on thursday to offer to build and maintain the pipeline in an effort to ship 36 trillion cubic feet of north slope natural gas . the group intends to make a proposal to the three major oil companies by december , a spokesman for the consortium said . " the economic benefits of this multi - billion dollar project would impact most regions of the u . s . and canada , " said mike stewart , co - chief executive officer of foothills pipe lines . foothills reached the agreement with transcanada pipelines , westcoast energy and american companies williams , duke energy , el paso corp . , enron , pg & e corp . and sempra energy international . the groups comprise the original alaskan northwest natural gas transportation company which had first proposed building this project in the 1970 s . under the terms of the agreement , the companies plan to dismiss $ 4 billion in costs and interest associated with the dormant project that would have been charged to developers of the pipeline . the money represents their original investment , with interest . " their intention is to remove that as an issue , " said foothills spokesman rocco ciancio . that was seen as a key roadblock to building an all - alaska pipeline to the lower 48 by officials with the state , which would own 12 . 5 percent of any natural gas pumped out of the north slope . " now that that ' s been resolved , it ' s time the producers come to the table with pipeline companies , the state of alaska and other players to get this project underway , " said gov . tony knowles . exxon mobil , phillips and bp have spent millions studying the viability of the project and , so far , have determined it is not profitable . knowles and other state officials have been pressuring the oil companies to build a route that generally follows the trans - alaska oil pipeline and the alaska highway to alberta . it would provide jobs for alaskans , cheap natural gas to communities and revenues for state services , knowles said . but canadian officials have pushed for a beaufort sea route that taps into rich reserves stranded in the mackenzie delta . the oil companies estimate the canadian route would cost $ 15 . 1 billion compared to the alaska highway route , which would cost $ 17 billion . ciancio said his group estimates a pipeline would cost $ 9 . 7 billion to construct and would get the natural gas to market quicker than other proposals . the consortium has held permits to build the all - alaska route since 1976 . " we ' re estimating it would take a greenfield ( start up ) project somewhere near two to three years to reach the same state of readiness as this project , " ciancio said . the consortium ' s project proposes running a 42 - inch pipe from prudhoe bay to alberta where the companies have other pipelines to ship natural gas to chicago and san francisco , he said . if agreements are reached quickly with the oil companies , the pipeline could be in operation by 2008 , ciancio said . a spokesman for the oil producers team which is studying the project greeted the news and said it would welcome any pipeline plan that would be profitable . " we ' re happy to see efforts being made to support an alaska pipeline project , " said dave macdowell , spokesman for the oil producer ' s group . " we ' re absolutely open to folks coming forward with efficient economic projects .

" while janus again cut sharply into its stake in sun - dropping 14 . 7 million shares - its holdings of cisco and oracle were nearly unchanged in the quarter , the filing showed . janus also cut about 12 . 6 million shares of advanced micro devices inc . . on the other hand , the company added some 13 . 6 million shares of microsoft corp . and boosted its stakes in jds uniphase and ebay inc . . the funds also more than doubled their holdings in berkshire hathaway inc . to 320 , 691 shares . the filing showed that janus made almost no change in the third quarter to its holding of enron corp . , the energy trading company whose stock collapsed amid a u . s . regulatory probe . at the end of the quarter , janus held 41 . 36 million shares in enron . the janus spokeswoman would not comment on the enron shares , but said that the filings are dated and don ' t necessarily reflect current holdings . shares of enron plunged in mid - october as investors rebelled over the company ' s off - the - balance - sheet deals that are now under investigation . enron whose stock is off 63 percent so far in the fourth quarter . the company agreed last week to be acquired by smaller rival dynegy inc . for about $ 9 billion in stock . janus ' s stake in exxon mobil corp . more than doubled to 39 . 8 million shares in the quarter . janus ' s stock holdings were worth $ 102 . 09 billion at the end of the quarter , down from $ 141 . 05 billion at the end of the second quarter . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . cash infusion little comfort to enron counterparties by andrew dowell of dow jones newswires 11 / 15 / 2001 dow jones energy service ( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones & company , inc . ) new york - ( dow jones ) - one and a half billion dollars doesn ' t go as far as it used to . despite a cash injection of that size from dynegy inc . ( dyn ) this week , u . s . energy companies continue to restrict their dealings with enron corp . ( ene ) , traders in the u . s . power and natural gas markets said wednesday . traders said they were doing deals with the houston - based energy giant when necessary , and some reported that activity appears to have picked up . but traders said they were continuing to limit their exposure and doing business with other parties if possible until enron ' s credit rating improves . " it ' s a company with one foot on a banana peel and one foot in the grave , " said ed kennedy , a miami - based trader with pioneer futures . both moody ' s investors service and standard & poor ' s rate enron one notch above speculative grade . moody ' s has enron ' s ratings on review for a downgrade , and s & p has enron on negative credit watch . enron ' s ability to do business in the energy markets depends on its maintaining investment - grade ratings . tuesday ' s infusion of cash from dynegy , which has agreed to buy enron in a stock - swap currently worth about $ 10 billion , isn ' t enough to change the outlook for enron , said todd shipman , a director in the u . s . utilities group at s & p . instead , the firm will be watching to see whether enron can hold on to its core business of trading north american gas and power . if it does , s & p may revisit enron ' s credit - watch status after new year ' s with an eye to upgrading it to " positive , " shipman said . circular reasoning that sets up a staredown of sorts between the ratings agency and the energy markets , with each waiting for the other to take the first step . " it always has been a sort of face - off , " shipman said . " for the time being , we ' re standing pat unless the situation at enron gets significantly worse . " moody ' s wasn ' t immediately available for comment . traders and their companies said consistently that until enron ' s credit ratings improve , they will continue to watch their exposure to enron carefully , with trades limited to short - term deals . mirant corp . ( mir ) is trading with enron on " a very limited basis " that won ' t be broadened until enron ' s credit situation improves , spokesman chuck griffin said . aquila corp . ( ila ) ceo keith stamm said the company was heartened by dynegy ' s injection of cash and was continuing to monitor enron ' s condition . " the $ 1 . 5 billion has improved their situation with us , and we ' ll keep watching the situation , " stamm said . on monday , aquila said it had whittled down its exposure to enron significantly . enron spokesman eric thode said 30 - day - moving - average volumes on enrononline , the internet - based trading platform on which enron is the counterparty in every deal , have improved to a more typical 5 , 700 transactions per day with a notional value of $ 2 . 7 billion . " volumes have returned to the normal range , " he said . some traders said enron ' s short - term business does appear to have picked up from earlier this week . staffing changes a concern enron is the country ' s largest trader of natural gas and electricity , accounting for up to a quarter of both markets by some estimates . even when companies aren ' t prohibiting their traders from doing business with enron , some traders are taking steps on their own to limit exposure . one funds analyst said the possibility of staffing changes at enron are contributing to traders ' reluctance to do business with the company . " you have headhunters out there , " the analyst said . " why tie yourself down with a five - year deal with someone who may not be there ? " enron currently employes about 1 , 500 people in its trading operation , and dynegy employes some 300 . the acquisition is expected to produce cuts , but dynegy hasn ' t said to what degree . energy companies began shying away from enron over the past month , as concerns about its finances precipitated a 75 % drop in its stock price and left its bonds trading at levels typically associated with distressed debt . enron ' s restatement of four and a half years ' worth of earnings last thursday and ratings downgrades friday led some companies to severely restrict their business with enron , even if that meant paying higher prices or accepting lower bids to do so . enron ' s ability to recover that business is critical to its future , s 201 - 938 - 4430 ; andrew . dowell @ dowjones . com ( john edmiston in houston , jon kamp in chicago and mark golden in new york contributed to this article . ) copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . dynegy may want some of enron ' s broadband assets by erwin seba of dow jones newswires 11 / 15 / 2001 dow jones energy service ( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones & company , inc . ) houston - ( dow jones ) - enron corp . ( ene ) may be planning to unwind its broadband services unit , but before it can do so , it may have to gain approval from its future new owner . dynegy inc . ( dyn ) is just beginning to look at which assets it wants to keep from enron ' s non - core businesses . " what we ' re saying at this point very , very early on is that we want to look and see if there are pieces of ( the optical fiber network ) that complement our strategy , " dynegy spokeswoman jennifer rosser told dow jones newswires . " and we ' re going to take the opportunity to review that . " one thing is clear , though : enron is leaving the bandwidth market in which the company has been the principal market - maker . " i think we ' ve made it pretty clear what our non - core businesses are , " enron broadband services spokeswoman shelly mansfield told dow jones . " we ' re going to be exiting those businesses in an orderly fashion . " but thursday morning enron bandwidth traders said they haven ' t been told what will become of them . many of them came to the bandwidth desk from the company ' s energy trading operations . " i ' ve not been given any definitive information , " a trader said . traders and brokers who are counterparties to enron said enron ' s traders remain active in the bandwidth market , regularly showing prices for various contracts . dynegy traders are also present in the market , but not as pervasively as enron traders have been , said one broker . dynegy ' s traders regularly show a high offer price without presenting a bid price , a broker said . usually dynegy traders will stay with that high offer expecting buyers in the market to come to them . also , the broker said , dynegy seems most active with contracts on the new york - miami route . in addition to deciding what to do with enron ' s network , dynegy also faces decisions about whether to retain enron ' s bandwidth traders and the contracts the company still holds for bandwidth services . guiding dynegy ' s decisions will be a continuing commitment to its own bandwidth strategy . " dynegy has been focused on building very long - term customer relationships , " rosser said . " we are focused , just as we have been in our energy business , on being a value - added provider to our customers . we have maintained a focus on the wholesale market . . . and large enterprise consumers of bandwidth . we have maintained focus on structured transactions and not trading , primarily because we don ' t think a true trading environment exists yet . " while enron may attempt to sell its network in the nine to 12 months before the merger is completed , it may be unable to do so , brokers of physical assets and bandwidth said . most optical networks are being broken up for sale , said physical assets brokers . - by erwin seba , dow jones newswires , 713 - 547 - 9214 erwin . seba @ dowjones . com copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved .

" you can consider this situation to be very extraordinary , " garris said . " unless we can get permanent and full - time positions approved , these are the rules we have to follow to be able to hire [ consultants ] . " garris insisted that it is unfair to compare lee ' s contract with the six - month , $ 120 , 000 deal that freeman - - the former boss at several major utilities - - struck with the governor . " i don ' t want to compare susan lee to david freeman , " garris said . " david comes from the los angeles department of water and power and susan came from a [ private ] power marketer . with susan , we just followed the standard formula . " in her new job , lee will direct an immensely complicated , around - the - clock operation responsible for " procuring energy , scheduling power and associated transmission , and reconciling deviations between contracts and deliveries , " according to her contract . lee ' s resume , attached to the contract , shows that she had no experience in the energy field until march 2000 , when she joined mieco . there , she was a trader and power scheduler , not a manager . " she was only here for a year or so , " said dina alvarez , an administrative manager for the company . a 1994 graduate of ucla with a degree in economics , she worked as a pension and benefits manager in los angeles and new york before joining mieco . lee ' s contract stands out compared to others disclosed this week , not only for its size but for her relative inexperience in the energy field . she is being paid $ 120 an hour and can earn a maximum of $ 480 , 000 , including expenses , by april 2003 . another new consultant , william l . green , has almost a quarter of a century of experience working for the bonneville power administration , pacific gas & electric and the california independent system operator . he is being paid $ 85 an hour to supervise workers who reconcile the state ' s accounting of energy purchases . his two - year deal is worth up to $ 340 , 000 . they are not alone in cutting lucrative deals . richard ferreira , the former assistant general manager at the sacramento municipal utilities district , has a $ 500 , 000 contract and is being paid $ 200 an hour to assist the state in negotiating power purchase contracts . he worked for the department of water resources for 23 years before joining the sacramento agency in 1987 . hardy energy consulting also has a $ 150 , 000 , six - month contract that calls for randy harvey to be paid $ 300 an hour . harvey has a quarter of a century of energy experience , particularly at the bonneville power administration , where he was chief executive officer from 1991 to 1997 . lee ' s recruiter , garris , said her lack of experience is not a concern .

Subject: corrected : new update on ppi model for inflation book dear all , i followed up on the suggestions at the conference call as follows : - 1 ) use less data unfortunately , kicking out only 1990 makes the overall equation a lot less robust , in fact dramatically so , and so eliminates the possibility of using less data . the model tested was the rpi ( month + 15 ) ppi pre - empts the moves in rpi by about 8 months . the magnitude of the oscillations is also reduced . this shows that if we had more detail in our rpi forward curve , then the ppi model would reflect those peaks and humps adequately . conclusion i therefore propose that we use the model that incorporates rpi , rpi [ t + 15 ] and deviations of brent crude from long - term average . the new model is plotted below in burgundy and can be compared to the old ppi which is depicted in blue . the new model achieves the two main objectives of the ppi curve : it is significantly more robust and stable than the existing one , and it is considerably less sensitive to the input coefficients , which results in us having more confidence in our monthly p it was found that deviations of dated brent crude from the long - term average of $ 18 . 80 was the best form of the variable to use ( for predictions the brent forward curve produced by the global products group is used ) . the three new equations developed were : - pllu ( t ) = a . rpi ( t ) + b . rpi ( t + n ) + c . ( datedbrentcrude - 18 . 8 ) + constant , where n is 14 , 15 or 16 [ reddish curves ] r - squared approx 0 . 49 f - stat approx 32 the chart below shows what our projected pllu curve would be given this equation , and also the three best relations from before which were based upon current and future rpi : pllu ( t ) = a . rpi ( t ) + b . rpi ( t + n ) + constant , where n is 14 , 15 or 16 [ greenish curves ] r - squared approx 0 . 47 f - stat approx 45 comparison of models as you can see , the two equations differ in the very short - term and very long - term ; the inclusion of deviations of brent crude leads to short - term predictions of 3 . 0 % to 3 . 2 % over the next six months . the greenish curves predict pllu in the range of 2 . 5 % to 2 . 8 % over the next six months . the curves are then very similar until 2009 , when the models including crude break - away to the upside , relative to the falling rpi curve . the model based purely on rpi hugs the rpi curve much more closely in the longer term . this is only important to the extent that we have large positions beyond 2009 ( which we don ' t ) . suggestion what could be useful now is a differently - specified model designed to forecast only the next 3 months , using auto - regressive or auto - regressive error terms . this model would be far more accurate in the near - term , and we could include this information onto the front of this long - term model . this may be useful , despite the fact that most of our exposure is in future time buckets . back - testing all the models give similar visual and statistical performance over the data sample used ( based mainly on 1990 s " new paradigm " economy ) . hopefully we can discuss these and other points later in the tele - conference ; your ideas on this would be appreciated . regards , anjam x 35383

Subject: california update 4 / 9 / 01 here is what we know so far with the recent announcement of a deal between socal and the state for the transmission lines : ? the deal may be enough to save socal from bankruptcy . this will depend on the payment terms as well as how soon socal can receive a positive cash flow . ? we are not sure if the state can really do a deal without pg & e or a deal for whole grid . it was thought that a transmission asset deal was not possible without pg the state may still be making the deal contingent upon the purchasing of pg & e ' s assets . a generator source reports that the state is intending to put pressure on the bankruptcy court to close the deal on pg & e ' s lines quickly . however , bankruptcy courts usually do not operate in this manner . in most cases the court would have to hold open proceedings , have competitive bids , etc . ? this purchase would need legislative approval , which is not guaranteed . previously the plan was for the state to purchase sce ' s and pg & e ' s assets at a premium so that they would not have to finance power purchases - the utilities would be able to buy power for themselves . now they would have to purchase sce ' s lines , but still finance power purchases because of pg & e . additionally , it is possible that socal swapped the clause allowing then to raise rates in order to recoup past debt in favor for an additional book price . if this any form of a utility bailout - it would probably no gain legislative approval . ? the purchase would also need ferc approval . as stated before , if ferc approves such a plan it would be with several conditions for california .

" enron makes the market . make no mistake about that , " said merrill lynch analyst donato eassey . " there ' s not a trader out there that doesn ' t use enrononline . " as such , enron enters into thousands of transactions every day in which the company ' s credit - worthiness is critical . enron said its business operations were functioning normally yesterday . the company also has consistently said it is financially strong and liquid . enron said its new chief financial officer is jeffrey mcmahon , the 40 - year - old head of the company ' s industrial - markets division . his selection may be intended , in part , to raise the company ' s credibility . people familiar with the matter say mr . mcmahon left his job as treasurer last year after voicing concerns within the company about mr . fastow ' s role in running two limited partnerships that were involved in billions of dollars worth of transactions with enron . internal partnership documents indicate mr . fastow and possibly a handful of associates made millions of dollars from the partnerships . mr . fastow severed his ties with those partnerships in july in the face of increasing conflict - of - interest concerns being expressed by wall street analysts and major enron investors . on monday , enron announced that the securities and exchange commission was looking into the fastow - related transactions . while enron as recently as tuesday strongly defended mr . fastow , as well as the company ' s dealings with the partnerships , controversy over those arrangements clearly played a role in the executive ' s departure . " in my continued discussions with the financial community , it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace andy as cfo , " said chairman and chief executive kenneth lay in a prepared statement . enron said mr . fastow " will be on a leave of absence from the company . " he couldn ' t be reached for comment . it remains to be seen how much mr . fastow ' s removal will assuage an increasingly restive investment community . the action came after the 4 p . m . market close and followed a day in which enron ' s stock once again plunged . as of 4 p . m . in new york stock exchange composite trading , enron shares were at $ 16 . 41 , down $ 3 . 38 , or 17 % . it topped the big board ' s most active list at nearly 76 million shares , more than twice the volume of the second - most - active stock . several trades yesterday involved blocks of 800 , 000 shares or more , possibly indicating that some institutional holders are souring on enron stock . enron ' s shares are down about 50 % from the beginning of last week . earlier this year , the stock was above $ 80 a share . in an apparent ripple effect , the stocks of other energy - trading companies , which do business with enron , also fell sharply yesterday . for instance , dynegy inc . shares on the big board were off $ 5 . 45 , or 13 % , at $ 37 . 26 . a number of the energy companies hit by the selloff have business strategies much different than enron ' s , which rely heavily on complex and highly structured investment vehicles . prudential securities analyst carol coale said mr . fastow ' s departure could be seen as evidence that " management does care " about investor concerns . however , she adds , the move also could be viewed by some investors , coming as it did two days after the announcement of the sec inquiry , as " an admission of guilt . " ms . coale yesterday issued a sell recommendation on enron largely because of uncertainties about the company ' s extremely complex financial structure . enron has consistently denied any wrongdoing in its fastow - related dealings . worries and rumors about enron ' s financial strength could be found in the stock market yesterday . goldman sachs analyst david fleischer said he heard people voice concerns about a possible " death spiral " in which increasing credit concerns about enron would decrease the number of people willing to do business with the company , which would in turn weaken its finances and lead to further business reductions . mr . fleischer , a longtime fan who still has a buy recommendation on the company , said he hasn ' t yet seen any evidence of such a problem . however , mr . fleischer said , enron needs to disclose more information about its myriad of financial transactions with related partnerships and other entities . enron is facing a problem with " trust and credibility . it ' s not easy to regain something as basic as trust , " he said . copyright ? 2000 dow jones section c enron ousts finance chief as s . e . c . looks at dealings by floyd norris 10 / 25 / 2001 the new york times page 2 , column 5 c . 2001 new york times company the enron corporation , its stock battered by a sudden loss of investor confidence , yesterday ousted its chief financial officer , andrew s . fastow , whose involvement in complicated transactions with enron has drawn the scrutiny of the securities and exchange commission . ' ' in my continued discussions with the financial community , it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace andy as c . f . o . , ' ' kenneth l . lay , enron ' s chairman and chief executive , said in a statement announcing the change . only one day before , mr . lay had told investors in a conference call that he and the enron board ' ' continue to have the highest faith and confidence in andy . ' ' the company said that mr . fastow had taken a leave of absence , but it also named his successor , jeffrey mcmahon , the head of enron ' s industrial markets group and a former corporate treasurer . enron said none of the officials were available for interviews last night . the move came after the close of trading on the new york stock exchange , where enron ' s shares fell $ 3 . 38 , to $ 16 . 41 . the price has been cut in half since oct . 16 , when enron reported its third - quarter earnings . a $ 1 . 2 billion reduction in shareholder equity brought on by ending some relationships with partnerships that mr . fastow had headed was not disclosed in the earnings news release . mr . lay briefly mentioned it in the conference call that followed , but some analysts thought he was referring to a separate $ 1 billion write - off that was disclosed in the earnings document , and were angered when they later learned about it . on tuesday , when both mr . fastow and mr . lay discussed the company with analysts on the conference call , neither was willing to discuss details of the transactions between enron and the partnerships formerly controlled by mr . fastow . mr . lay cited the s . e . c . inquiry in declining to discuss the details of the transactions . the fact the transactions took place has been known for a year , but enron ' s disclosures have been widely criticized for being impossible to understand . by structuring the deals as involving forward commitments to deliver enron stock , it appears that enron was able to assure that losses on them would not lead to reported losses , but instead to reductions of shareholder equity that had no effect on the income statement . that is one of the issues the s . e . c . , whose inquiries were disclosed monday by the company , is expected to address . concerns have also grown this week over whether enron will face losses from complicated financing strategies that kept billions of dollars of debts off its balance sheet but left the company responsible for paying - - either in cash or with stock - - if things went wrong . on tuesday , mr . fastow assured investors that the company ' ' expects to continue to have sufficient liquidity to meet normal obligations , ' ' and said it had bank credit lines that were more than adequate . mr . fastow was viewed as one of the architects , with jeffrey k . skilling , the former enron chief executive who resigned in august , of the change in business strategy that turned enron from a gas - pipeline company into a an energy trading powerhouse that developed a large wall street following . its stock price peaked in the summer of 2000 at $ 90 . 75 . according to a person close to the company , while mr . mcmahon , mr . fastow ' s successor , was enron ' s treasurer , he told mr . skilling , who at the time was the chief operating officer , that he thought the partnerships involving mr . fastow presented a conflict of interest . after that discussion , mr . mcmahon moved to a different job at the company , this person said . shares of enron traded as low as $ 15 . 51 yesterday afternoon , the lowest price for the stock since early 1995 , before recovering . in after - hours trading , they fell to $ 16 . 14 . one of the factors that hurt the stock yesterday was a decision by m . carol coale , an analyst at prudential securities , to drop her rating to ' ' sell ' ' from ' ' hold . ' ' she had lowered the rating to ' ' hold ' ' from ' ' buy ' ' on monday . ' ' after the s . e . c . inquiry was announced , ' ' she said in an interview yesterday evening , ' ' enron should have addressed it by delivering a scapegoat , as a gesture to the street . now they are replacing him today . the timing is a little late , but i think it will be received positively by the street . ' ' but she said that investor sentiment might work the other way . ' ' people could fear that if you remove fastow from the management team , you ' ll never get any answers .

" in my continued discussions with the financial community , it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace andy as cfo , " enron chairman and ceo ken lay said in a statement after the stock market closed on a day investors continued dumping shares . enron , which had seen its stock battered this year for a variety of reasons , found itself high on wall street ' s hit list after it released third - quarter earnings on oct 16 . the earnings report drew renewed attention to something investors and analysts had already expressed displeasure at : fastow , with the approval of enron ' s board , had formed and run two investment partnerships - - ljm cayman and ljm 2 co - investment . the partnerships , which did complex financing and hedging deals with enron , served as a source of funding for enron projects and investments . but wall street questioned how fastow could watch out for the interests of enron ' s shareholders and the investment partnership at the same time . so fastow , in june , resigned his roles at the partnerships and enron also ended its relationships with the ljm entities . during the third - quarter , enron took a $ 35 million loss related to ending its ljm ties as well as a $ 1 . 2 billion reduction in shareholder equity . tuesday , lay told analysts and investors that procedures were rigorously followed to ensure the interests of enron and its shareholders were protected in dealings with the ljm partnerships . he said a " chinese wall " existed between enron and ljm . fastow ' s replacement , mcmahon , previously served as enron ' s treasurer before moving last year to another job with enron . most recently , he headed up the company ' s industrial markets group . a source close to enron said mcmahon asked to be reassigned from the treasurer ' s job because he was uncomfortable with the fastow - ljm setup . enron spokesman mark palmer said neither fastow nor mcmahon was available for comment wednesday . he also didn ' t know whether fastow is still receiving a salary . enron disclosed on monday that federal securities regulators had begun an " informal inquiry " into the ljm dealings . the news proved terrible for a company already working to rebuild investor confidence after a series of failed investments in telecommunications , water and retail power businesses and the surprise resignation of ceo jeff skilling in august for personal reasons . a continuously growing number of shareholder lawsuits against enron followed the earnings report and the news of the sec inquiry . wall street has stepped up its chronic complaints that enron ' s various financial dealings are too complex to follow and that the company fails to give analysts enough data to make proper evaluations . beyond the ljm partnerships , investors are concerned about two other partnerships enron set up . among the worries is that enron will end up having to issue new shares of stock to cover commitments associated with those entities . investors wouldn ' t like that because it would dilute the value of current outstanding shares . they are also afraid that enron ' s debt credit rating may be downgraded , which could have negative impacts on its overall business . in the last six days , enron ' s shares have closed lower and lower . on oct . 16 , the stock closed at $ 33 . 84 . on wednesday it closed at $ 16 . 41 , down $ 3 . 38 . wednesday , the hubbub surrounding enron also dragged down shares in other companies that engage in energy trading , including houston - based dynegy , which closed down $ 5 . 45 at $ 37 . 26 . there is concern enron ' s woes could in some way end up harming the energy trading markets . a conference call lay and senior executives , including fastow , held with analysts tuesday to help clear up questions didn ' t go as enron hoped . on wednesday , carol coale , an analyst with prudential securities in houston , moved from a " hold " to a " sell " rating . front page -

first section - enron replaces finance chief - energy company attempts to halt sharp decline in its share price . enron , the us energy group , yesterday replaced its embattled chief financial officer , andrew fastow , to try to halt a slide in its share price , which has lost about 40 per cent of its value this week . kenneth lay , enron ' s chief executive officer , said after the market closed that mr fastow was taking a leave of absence . the move came a day after mr lay defended mr fastow amid questions about his ties to controversial partnerships that had forced enron to take a $ 1 . 2 bn write - off . that loss , revealed last week , sparked the share sell - off amid concerns there may be more bad news to come . enron disclosed the loss during an october 16 conference call with analysts on its third - quarter results , saying the charge stemmed from closing funding mechanisms that enron had set up in the partnerships established with mr fastow . analysts say the charge has not been satisfactorily explained , leading to confusion among investors and an unofficial inquiry by the securities and exchange commission . " in my continued discussions with the financial community , it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace andy as cfo , " mr lay said . he said jeff mcmahon , chairman and chief executive of enron ' s industrial markets group , would replace mr fastow . mr mcmahon earlier served as enron ' s treasurer . analysts said it was unclear whether mr fastow ' s departure would be enough . carol coale , of prudential securities , said the move was positive in demonstrating that enron was being sensitive to wall street , which had called for mr fastow to be replaced . yet , she added , it came three days after those calls . ms coale issued a " sell " recommendation on enron earlier yesterday , leading to a drop of almost 18 per cent in its share price .

' ' on a recent conference call ` ` no one thought they did themselves any favor in terms of calming investors ' concerns . ' ' ` ` they were slightly hiding behind the fact that the sec has got this inquiry going . the fact that two days later andy is gone , and he was in the center , is a good sign that the company is realizing just how concerned investors are . ' ' ` ` there ' s always that worry once the sec gets involved that it could extend . you never know what could come of that . ' ' ` ` there is a bit of fear of the unknown about enron now , with the sec inquiry and the risk that there could be further asset write - downs . ' ' ` ` another thing they ' re criticized for is their lack of disclosure . we still haven ' t seen a balance sheet for the third quarter . ' ' ` ` people are saying , why don ' t you include a balance sheet with your results ? they promised better disclosure in the past and that was meant to begin in the third quarter . ' ' ` ` you ' d like to see just more information on asset write - downs and a discussion of their off - balance - sheet financing - - all these vehicles they have like marlin and osprey . ' ' ` ` we ' d like to see some clarity , answering those sort of questions . ' ' ` ` it seems as though enron at least are maybe at the start of a process where they ' re going to address and clean up their balance sheet and they ' ve started to replace management . ' ' ` ` investors have already had enough issues ' ' in corporate bonds recently and ` ` sometimes investors just think , ` not another nasty in my portfolio , ' and i ' d rather exit . ' ' ` ` for certain investors maybe they just get scared . i wanted to know more about it . people had speculated if it could go to junk . i don ' t think they could because i don ' t think enron could exist as a junk company . ' ' ` ` there ' s a certain reluctance ' ' to sell the bonds . ` ` you want to stand back for a moment and look at the fundamentals . ' ' ` ` when the spreads have already moved out that wide you have to reassess and see whether you think it ' s a buying opportunity .

" it could either be viewed as a positive step toward easing investor concern or it could be interpreted as if enron removed the cfo at the request of the sec , " prudential securities inc . analyst carol coale said wednesday . " who knows ? " enron officials hope it will result in increased investor confidence after the energy trading giant ' s stocks have declined in value each day since monday ' s announcement that the sec had inquired about partnerships that did business with enron while they were managed by fastow . " in my continued discussions with the financial community , it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace andy as cfo , " enron chief executive officer kenneth lay said after markets closed wednesday . fastow will take a leave of absence from the company while jeff mcmahon , who has served as chairman and chief executive of enron ' s industrial markets group , takes over his role . " i think change is good at this particular point in time , " said fac equities analyst robert christensen said . " i think andy was somewhat beleaguered . " a . g . edwards & sons analyst mike heim , however , said it will take more than replacing fastow as chief financial officer to clear the uncertainty looming in the financial world about enron and its partnerships . " i think the reason why the stock has been declining so sharply the last few days is due to a lack of clarity on the partnership arrangements , " heim said . replacing fastow alone won ' t clarify those arrangements , he added . " there is still uncertainty despite promises by management to be more transparent to the financial community , " heim said . " instead of being more transparent there is more confusion than ever . " enron ' s stock continued to plummet wednesday , closing down $ 3 . 38 to $ 16 . 41 per share , a 17 percent decline . since the wall street journal first reported on the partnerships last week , enron ' s stock price has slid nearly 52 percent . " the market was asking for that to happen , " j . p . morgan analyst anatol feygin said of fastow ' s departure . " this is really the first time enron has acted as an agent of the shareholder in this crisis . " previously , enron ' s managers have been " cautious and defensive in their approach , " he said . during a conference call tuesday to address investor concern , lay said the partnerships were fully disclosed and contained measures to ensure no conflict existed as fastow carried out the dual roles . the partnerships have since been dissolved . the call didn ' t work for many , including feygin and heim . " i didn ' t hear things like we ' ve unrolled all these partnership dealings or here ' s all the exact details of how the partnerships work or we don ' t ever expect to take any more charges , " heim said . " what i heard is we don ' t have to disclose that information until the 10 - q is filed . " the turbulent past few months which have included the sec inquiry , third quarter losses and the august resignation of the company ' s chief executive officer , jeff skilling , have left many analysts questioning the company ' s future , heim said . " it ' s really a speculative bet right now , but the odds favor the company being able to weather the storm and being a healthy company if not a year from now , two years from now , " he said . but much is going to depend on how much enron discloses to its investors , feygin said . feygin said mcmahon worked as enron ' s treasurer for two years under fastow before a disagreement over fastow ' s involvement in the partnerships caused mcmahon to leave his job as treasurer . " internally , jeff was always a proponent of andy not being involved in ( the partnerships ) , " feygin said . " three days ago i would have said there is no need for a change at the cfo level . today , it was pretty obvious it was something enron needed to do .

" investors were clearly not comfortable with exposure to andy , " said j . p . morgan analyst anatol feygin , who downgraded enron to " long - term buy " and owns no shares . fastow , 39 , ran ljm cayman and ljm 2 co - investment , two partnerships created by enron to buy company assets . enron ' s involvement in the financing vehicles cost the company $ 35 million in third - quarter losses . enron also bought back 62 million shares from ljm 2 at a cost of $ 1 . 2 billion to unwind its investment . during a conference call tuesday , lay said , " i and enron ' s board of directors continue to have the highest faith and confidence in andy and think he ' s doing an outstanding job as cfo .

2000 dow jones a press release says fastow is taking a leave of absence . he ' s been replaced by jeffrey mcmahon , formerly ceo of enron ' s industrial markets group . how might the enron bulls spin this ? likely , they will point to mcmahon ' s alleged opposition to fastow ' s role in the big hedging deal , called ljm 2 , to show that the " fastow era " is over . the wall street journal , citing anonymous sources , reported tuesday that as treasurer at enron mcmahon complained about fastow ' s possible conflict of interest . probably , the fear was that fastow couldn ' t serve enron and ljm 2 equally , especially as he was allegedly making a lot of money from ljm 2 . clearly , if mcmahon turns out to be a new broom , that ' s a positive for enron . an enron spokeswoman declined to comment on whether the journal ' s account of mcmahon ' s stance on ljm 2 was correct . not much else is encouraging , however . fastow ' s departure shows that it took massive drops in enron stock to force senior management into action . on a difficult conference call tuesday , ceo ken lay gave fastow resounding backing . it took wednesday ' s plunge to get lay to sign off on a new cfo . in other words , lay listens only when the market screams and hollers . how much further does the stock have to fall to bring further much - needed reforms at the company ? the spokeswoman responds that lay had discussions with analysts tuesday and wednesday that led him to the conclusion that fastow ' s replacement was necessary to rebuild investor confidence . enron culture is thick with financial sorcery . people got upset by one shadowy deal , but no one knows exactly how the company ' s core energy trading business makes money . it ' s hard to believe the ljm 2 deals were done in isolation and without the knowledge of the board . in fact , the chatter is that fastow and former ceo jeff skilling proposed the ljm 2 transactions to the board after it was reluctant to enter the broadband business . the board apparently feared the volatility that might come from being in broadband , so fastow allegedly proposed ljm 2 as a way to hedge that volatility away . this meant ljm 2 entered agreements that gave it access to increases in the value of broadband assets but protected enron from the downside . should the whole board be on the hook , too ? the spokeswoman responds that the board would not have entered the ljm 2 transaction if it had not thought it would benefit enron and its shareholders . lay has shown himself to be woefully out of touch with the market ' s views . arguably , that ' s downright reckless for a trading company that is dependent on potentially skittish short - term financing . letting things get this bad has risked good faith among enron counterparties and bankers . it shows an unhealthy reluctance to address key problems until they ' re unavoidable . the spokeswoman responds that the company is now working hard to improve transparency . any efforts in that direction will be much appreciated , but is it any wonder people compare this lot to long term capital management ?

" andy fastow was a very well - regarded , low profile individual at enron , and he ' s been unfairly pilloried in the press , " said john olson , an analyst at sanders morris harris in houston .

" this company has been very much abused and maligned by people on wall street . they have some excellent businesses , and they have been carrying some losers . " enron has " an excellent growth profile and tremendous profitability in their growth businesses , and excellent surplus cash flow , " olson said . ? enron expects to generate $ 3 billion of cash flow this year , and with $ 500 million devoted to dividends and $ 1 billion to maintenance capital spending , the company will have $ 1 . 5 billion free . ? several wall street firms cut their ratings on enron shares wednesday , including prudential securities . the firm advised clients to sell the stock , a rare recommendation . prudential had rated the company ' s shares a " hold .

" management used the sec inquiry as a shield to avoid elaboration on the issue at hand , the ljm transactions , " coale said in reference to the conference call . ? olson said it ' s unlikely that enron , with its coterie of lawyers , would allow the creation of illegal investment vehicles , but as to whether it was " right , " he conceded it was probably not . ? j . p . morgan ' s anatol feygin downgraded his rating to " long - term buy " from " buy , " saying an upgrade is precluded until the company provides more information about its liabilities . ?

Subject: california update - 10 / 02 / 2001 for questions or comments regarding this report please contact g . britt whitman at ex : 5 - 4014 or kristin walsh at ex : 3 - 9510 . executive summray ? cpuc settles filed rate doctrine case with socal ? cpuc kills dwr rate agreement , davis may reconsider old senate bill cpuc - socal suit in a closed hearing today , the california public utilities commission voted 5 - 0 to settle its filed rate doctrine case with socal edison . the implications could save socal from an otherwise immanent bankruptcy , though bankruptcy remains a real threat . under the agreement , the cpuc has stipulated the following points , which have not yet been formalized by administrative law judge , ronald lew : ? the cpuc agrees to maintain a level of rates necessary for socal to pay off under - collect through 2003 . ? all surplus revenue ( revenue above o & m ) generated from any source must be applied to socal ' s back debt . ? socal agrees to pay no dividends on its common stock from now until 2003 , or until all back debt has been recovered . if socal ' s debt has not been recovered by 2003 , the cpuc will extend appropriate rates levels necessary for socal to recover its debt through 2004 . dividend payouts on socal common stock will be subject to cpuc approval during this extension . ? 100 % of any revenue socal receives / generates from ferc / generator refunds will be applied to socal ' s debt . ? once socal ' s back debt has been recovered , any surplus revenue generated from the cpuc rate hikes will be refunded to ratepayers . cpuc - dwr rate agreement the fact that the puc voted down the dwr rate agreement ( by a 4 - 1 margin ) puts governor davis and treasurer angelides in a very awkward position . this leaves senator burton ' s bill , sb 18 xx , as the vehicle that sets to payment path for the revenue bonds to repay the general fund . however , as late as this morning , governor davis vowed ( through his spokesman ) that sb 18 xx was " dead on arrival " and would be vetoed . this move by the puc puts pressure on davis to sign sb 18 xx in order to protect the bonds and the long - term power contacts he has negotiated . however , 18 xx violates the terms of a number of the long - term power contacts negotiated by the governor earlier this year . for example : ? sb 18 xx splits the revenue streams for payment of the general fund ' s revenue bonds and payment to the dwr for power . it clarifies the funds that will go to repay the general fund , but is much less clear on the funds to pay the dwr for power . sb 18 xx leaves the long - term contracts signed by the governor open to review and renegotiation - something that the governor remains publicly unwilling to do . ? sb 18 xx also violates the terms of the bridge loan the state negotiated with shearson lehman earlier this year . the terms of the bridge loan explicitly state that if 18 xx is passed , the banks can accelerate the loan or impose penalty terms of interest on the state . these terms were suggested by the governor as a means of forcing the legislature to support his dwr rate agreement rather than burton ' s . of course , this effort failed when the legislature easily passed sb 18 xx . today ' s puc action further complicates the situation . while on the surface this would seem to force the governor ' s hand into signing sb 18 xx , that may not , in fact , happen . it would not be out of character for the governor to instead veto sb 18 xx , then force either the legislature or the puc to " play ball " with him in order to repay the general fund . thus , another leverage point has been created . we will continue to monitor the situation to attempt to determine the likelihood of davis signing or vetoing sb 18 xx .

" it will be another good example of how the market does work . . . it will regain people ' s confidence in the market , " said guy america , vice president for credit derivatives at j . p . morgan chase in london . image problem however , other dealers predicted a messy conclusion . " the impact is clearly a loss of confidence in the credit derivative market overall , " said a default swaps trader with a european bank . the most recent corporate failure to trigger a large number of default swaps , that of u . k . rail operator railtrack , resulted in banks calling in lawyers to see if they had to pay out on certain obligations . dealers said enron was an actively traded name in the default swaps market , mainly in new york . as a privately negotiated market , it is difficult to get accurate figures for the value of contracts outstanding on enron , however , dealers said well over a billion dollars of protection on enron had been written . " ( it was ) one of the benchmark names for the us credit ( derivative market ) . . . so you can guess that a lot of people were involved in this credit through default swaps , " said the european bank trader . uncertain credit insurance potentially more damaging for the credit derivatives market is the failure of enron credit . the subsidiary specialised in selling credit risk mitigation tools to companies who wanted to hedge against customers going bankrupt and failing to pay . if end - users now find the derivatives they bought no longer give them the level of credit protection they expected , it may make it harder for banks in future to convince more of their customers to start using the tools . on the back of demand from end - users , enron credit was active in the inter - dealer default swaps market . a filing for bankruptcy by enron corp . could trigger settlement on all the contracts into which enron credit entered . this would involve a large number of contracts and dealers say this would be concentrated among the limited circle of banks , mainly enron corp . s bank lenders , which accepted enron credit as a dealing counterparty . " it was not broadly accepted as a counterparty , " said one dealer , who added that he hadn ' t seen the firm in the market since october . lenders face biggest loss however , most dealers concur that any losses the banks might incur on credit derivatives contracts would be small compared to potential lending losses . " counterparty losses would be dwarfed by direct lending exposure , " said the head of credit derivatives at a euroepan bank . dealers said some banks had looked at taking on the enron credit trading book but that this now looked unlikely . " the banks that were involved in trying to rescue the bank recently . . were also involved in overlooking their credit book and potentially making a bid to take it into their own book , " said one trader . shares in enron fell 85 percent to 61 cents after a rescue deal by smaller rival dynegy inc fell apart on wednesday . on thursday the company said it may not pay previously declared dividends . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . uk : enron europe splits from u . s . parent . 11 / 29 / 2001 reuters english news service ( c ) reuters limited 2001 . london , nov 29 ( reuters ) - enron ' s european business said on thursday it has been operating separately from its u . s . parent company since wednesday when headquarters in houston stopped cash tranfers to the european trading business . accountants in london were appointed administrators on thursday to the european operation of crisis - hit enron . " effectively london is operating separately . the european operation gets cash from houston to trade - they stopped giving us cash yesterday , " said an enron europe spokesman . he said the administration order covered mainly the european wholesale trading business which is based in london . it does not cover seven separate businesses belonging to enron in the uk , including the teesside power station and regional water utility wessex water , as well as enron ' s european assets . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . usa : update 1 - enron may not pay previously declared dividends . 11 / 29 / 2001 reuters english news service ( c ) reuters limited 2001 . houston , nov 29 ( reuters ) - beleaguered energy trader enron corp . said on thursday it might not pay previously declared dividends on its various stock issues , in an effort to preserve the value of its core trading and marketing business . houston - based enron said the dividends in question are those on its common stock , cumulative second preferred convertible stock , enron capital llc 8 percent cumulative guaranteed monthly income preferred shares , and enron capital resources lp series a 9 percent cumulative preferred securities . enron shares closed at a new low of 61 cents on the new york stock exchange in trading on wednesday , the same day that hometown rival dynegy inc . decided to walk away from its planned purchase of the company . the major credit rating agencies slashed their ratings on enron ' s bonds to junk status , also on wednesday , triggering expectations that enron would be forced into bankruptcy . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . usa : u . s . stocks set to open flat to a little up . by haitham haddadin 11 / 29 / 2001 reuters english news service ( c ) reuters limited 2001 . new york , nov 29 ( reuters ) - stocks are set to open flat to slightly higher on thursday following some upbeat corporate outlooks , but mixed economic data and the aftermath of the near - collapse of energy trader enron corp . could affect trading . enron , teetering on the brink of one of the biggest corporate implosions in u . s . history , plunged 85 percent in frenzied trading wednesday . it dragged on the market as investors also sold amid worry that a rally from sept . 21 lows reached in the wake of the attacks on the united states was overdone . " the enron collapse may have significant ramifications on banks and other energy companies where contracts with enron may now not be honored . and the enron equity may be worthless , " said alan ackerman , market strategist with brokerage fahnestock & co . equity index futures were up but at one point off earlier highs after the release of data at 8 . 30 a . m . ( 1330 gmt ) that showed a rise in jobless claims but also a rise in durable goods orders . " there was a mixed response . we saw an encouraging number in the durable goods but it ' s too early to see this as a sustained trend up and layoffs continue to be a real concern , " ackerman added . the number of americans lining up for first - time jobless benefits rose by 54 , 000 last week , exceeding wall street expectations and showed continued weakening in the u . s . labor market . the data showed the number of so - called continued claims rose by 301 , 000 to 4 . 02 million for the week ended nov . 17 , the biggest one - week increase in 27 years . orders for costly u . s . durable goods surged at the fastest rate on record in october by 12 . 8 percent to $ 184 . 8 billion , led by huge increases in orders for aircraft and defense capital goods . the data may help rekindle hopes that the economy has rebounded since the sept . 11 attacks . equity index futures suggested a largely flat to slightly higher open . december futures for the s & p 500 index rose 1 . 70 points to 1 , 130 . 80 while futures for the nasdaq 100 added 8 points to 1 , 567 . futures for the dow jones industrials gained 7 points at 9 , 720 . other indicators flagged a mildly higher open . the indicative dow jones industrial average , which is based on prices of dow stocks trading in germany ' s deutsche boerse u . s . market segment , rose 45 . 95 points , or 0 . 47 percent , to 9 , 757 . 81 . the nasdaq - 100 premarket indicator was up 9 . 2 points , or 0 . 59 percent , based on trading ahead of the open in the tech - heavy index ' s biggest stocks . hand - held computer maker palm inc . rose in extended - hours trading on wednesday and pre - open trade on thursday after the company said it expects to meet estimates . palm rose to $ 3 . 7 pre - open from its nasdaq close of $ 3 . 41 . storage networking company brocade communications systems inc . rose to $ 30 . 30 ahead of the open from a close at $ 28 . 82 . the company reported quarterly operating profits fell sharply as the slower economy kept many corporate buyers on the sidelines , although the results beat wall street forecasts . enron , which finished at 61 cents on wednesday , was a little higher in pre - open trading , at 69 cents . enron sank wednesday after rival dynegy inc . pulled out of its planned $ 9 billion takeover of the beleaguered energy trader . credit rating agencies slashed enron ' s bonds to junk status and shoved the once mighty company another step closer to bankruptcy . enron squeezed other energy traders and financial giants citigroup inc . and jp morgan chase & co . inc . , which may suffer losses of more than $ 400 million combined on their lending to the energy trading group , according to at least one analyst . on wednesday , the blue - chip dow jones industrial average surrendered 160 . 74 points , or 1 . 63 percent , to 9 , 711 . 86 , the largest drop in about a month and the lowest close since nov . 12 . the broader standard & poor ' s 500 index slid 20 . 98 points , or 1 . 83 percent , to 1 , 128 . 52 . the technology - laced nasdaq composite index dropped 48 points , or 2 . 48 percent , to 1 , 887 . 97 . in other pre - open activity , software provider freemarkets inc . rose after raising its quarterly revenue and profit outlook after several large customers renewed long - term contracts . shares rose to $ 16 . 20 from a close of $ 13 . 59 . h & r block inc . , the no . 1 u . s . tax preparer , rose to $ 37 . 25 on the instinet trading system after closing at $ 36 on the new york stock exchange . the company raised its profit forecasts for the current fiscal year as its second - quarter loss narrowed , helped by new accounting rules and strong mortgage business performance . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . uk : enron europe not seen in default on energy trade . by raj rajendran 11 / 29 / 2001 reuters english news service ( c ) reuters limited 2001 . london , nov 29 ( reuters ) - beleaguered u . s . energy trader enron so far has not defaulted on any of its over - the - counter energy swap contracts in europe , dealers said on thursday . but many in the trading community have arranged alternative trades to cover their exposure as news emerged that enron had sought protection from its creditors and appointed accountant as administrator . enron stands on the brink of bankruptcy after a rescue deal with its smaller rival dynegy fell apart on wednesday . the company halted trading on its enrononline platform on the same day . " they haven ' t had any defaults yet . but nobody ' s trading with them at the moment , " a dealer at a major oil company which had trading links with enron said . dealers said enron had been missing from the european oil otc market for over a week and many companies had stopped trading with them a month ago as signs emerged of financial difficulties at america ' s largest energy trader . in the oil market , enron ' s trading activities extended right across the petroleum product chain as well as various brent crude derivatives contracts . they said the dated to front line ( dfl ) brent contract , which balances the risk of dated brent against the front - month ipe futures contract , had seen substantial activity on thursday amid speculation that some players had moved to square off their positions against exposures to enron . " it ' s a case of closing up positions , " a brent trader said . dealers said enron was believed to have closed positions on london ' s international petroleum exchange . the ipe declined comment . the dealers said a shortlived price spike late on wednesday on ipe and nymex crude oil and nymex natural gas futures markets suggested a brief session of short covering . " there was a short spell when the natural gas market was strengthening and wti moved up . one broker was doing most of the buying and most people thought he was covering for enron . but the market came straight back down , " said one futures dealer . an spokeswoman for the ipe said its compliance department was looking at enron ' s positions on the market and had been talking with financial services authority and clearing house .

( ene ) will not have a material impact on brokerage firms ' credit and counterparty energy trading exposure . in a research note thursday , moszkowski said the credit exposure to enron among the larger securities firms - morgan stanley ( mwd ) , merrill lynch & co . ( mer ) , goldman sachs group inc . ( gs ) , bear stearns cos . ( bsc ) and lehman brothers holdings inc . ( leh ) - is minimal and is largely hedged where it exists . among the larger brokers , only morgan stanley and goldman sachs have " meaningful " operations in energy trading , moszkowski said . " against the backdrop of significantly improved risk management procedures in the industry , we believe exposure to enron has been curtailed for some time now , particularly as concern regarding the firm ' s credit worthiness is hardly a new development , " moszkowski said .

" the dollar is a little heavy across the board , " said robert sinche , head of global currency strategy at citibank in new york . " unless you get something completely outrageous , it looks likely to remain that way . " the dollar has fallen below key support levels against both the euro and the yen , as traders moved to liquidate a spate of long dollar positions . while the enron situation doesn ' t have a direct effect on foreign exchange markets , analysts said that it wasn ' t helping dollar sentiment . " the market was ripe for an unwinding of long dollar positions , " said mr . sinche . " enron . . . is the kind of situation that just acts as a catalyst . " as is often the case , the euro ' s gains appeared to be more a result of pessimism towards the u . s . rather than any optimism about the euro zone . the market largely shrugged off third quarter euro - zone gross domestic product data earlier thursday which came in exactly as expected : up 0 . 1 % on the quarter and 1 . 3 % on the year . the dollar ' s direction thursday will also be influenced by u . s . shares , with prospects for a marked rebound looking slim in the wake of the enron woes . analysts said a sustained move above the 89 cent level could set the euro up for a test of 89 . 45 cents and then 90 cents , which is expected to offer more formidable resistance . its difficulty in making a concerted push for 90 cents is probably down to the potential outflows related to the morgan stanley capital international indexes rebalancing , and the deutsche telekom / voicestream deal . the first phase of the new msci weightings comes into effect friday , and should involve fund managers reducing their exposure to euro zone equities . so far , this seems to have been discounted , although it could still help to keep a lid on the euro . the lockup period for voicestream shareholders to keep hold of their deutsche telekom shares expires dec . 1 , which could prompt them to offload the stock , in effect resulting in sizable euro - zone outflows . benign inflation data from switzerland out earlier thursday - up only 0 . 3 % in november on the year - has paved the way for the swiss national bank to cut interest rates at its next meeting dec . 7 . " with the market looking only for a rate cut of 25 basis points , we would expect the swiss franc to remain capped around current levels , " said ubs warburg analysts . grainne mccarthy of dow jones newswires contributed to this article copyright ( c ) 2001 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . electrabel says exposure to enron " insignificant " 11 / 29 / 2001 dow jones international news ( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones 331 - 4017 - 1740 ; sarah . wachter @ dowjones . com copyright ? 2000 dow jones halts trading with enron 11 / 29 / 2001 pr newswire ( copyright ( c ) 2001 , pr newswire ) charlotte , n . c . , nov . 29 / prnewswire / - - duke energy ( nyse : duk ) today expressed confidence in the vitality of the energy sector and said it had taken steps to manage its exposure during the very serious difficulties being experienced by enron , including instituting a trading halt . " although we didn ' t completely cease trading with enron until yesterday , in the course of our normal credit practices , we took steps to limit our exposure to enron . we currently have approximately $ 100 million in non - collaterized exposure to enron . we are closely monitoring this unfortunate situation to determine if a provision against earnings is appropriate , " said richard j . osborne , executive vice president and chief risk officer for duke energy . osborne was referring to dynegy ' s announcement that it is terminating the merger agreement with enron and the decision by major rating agencies to downgrade enron ' s long - term debt below investment grade . " the market is larger than any one player and is very resilient . enron ' s role and activities in the energy market have significantly diminished over the past several weeks . and , market liquidity is provided by many active trading and marketing companies that have effective risk management practices and sound capitalizations , " osborne noted . " we at duke energy are committed to our customers and fulfilling our contracts and services without disruption . we also continue to see strong growth opportunities ahead and are extremely confident in our ability to achieve or exceed our financial targets this year and next , " osborne said . the company remains fully committed to deliver earnings growth within its stated guidance of 10 percent to 15 percent compound annual growth in earnings per share from a base of $ 2 . 10 in 2000 . based on the strong results reported for the first three quarters of this year , duke energy had previously communicated it will likely exceed 15 percent earnings growth in 2001 . yesterday ' s developments do not change that view . duke energy , a diversified multinational energy company , creates value for customers and shareholders through an integrated network of energy assets and expertise . duke energy manages a dynamic portfolio of natural gas and electric supply , delivery and trading businesses - - generating revenues of more than $ 49 billion in 2000 . duke energy , headquartered in charlotte , n . c . , is a fortune 100 company traded on the new york stock exchange under the symbol duk . more information about the company is available on the internet at : www . duke - energy . com . contact : jennifer hillings epstein of duke energy , + 1 - 704 - 382 - 1221 , or 24 - hour , + 1 - 704 - 382 - 8333 . make your opinion count - click here / contact : jennifer hillings epstein of duke energy , + 1 - 704 - 382 - 1221 , or 24 - hour , + 1 - 704 - 382 - 8333 / 09 : 30 est copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . dominion reports that enron exposure not expected to affect earnings forecast 11 / 29 / 2001 business wire ( copyright ( c ) 2001 , business wire ) richmond , va . - - ( business wire ) - - nov . 29 , 2001 - - dominion ( nyse : d ) said today that it has pre - tax credit exposure to enron of $ 11 million for past sales . dominion said it has forward commodity sales contracts with enron that represent an exposure of less than 5 percent of earnings , based on today ' s forward prices . dominion reaffirmed its public operating earnings per share targets of $ 4 . 15 or better in 2001 , $ 4 . 90 to $ 4 . 95 in 2002 and 10 percent annual earnings growth after 2002 . dominion is one of the nation ' s largest producers of natural gas and power . contact : dominion , richmond media : mark lazenby , 804 / 819 - 2042 hunter applewhite , 804 / 819 - 2043 or analysts : tom wohlfarth , 804 / 819 - 2150 suzette mata , 804 / 819 - 2154 09 : 06 est november 29 , 2001 copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . s & p lwrs rtg on yosemite ' s 2000 - a linked enron notes 11 / 29 / 2001 business wire ( copyright ( c ) 2001 , business wire ) london - - ( business wire ) - - standard & poor ' s - - nov . 29 , 2001 - - standard & poor ' s today lowered its rating on the gbp 200 million 8 . 75 % series 2000 - a linked enron obligations issued by yosemite securities co . ltd . to ' b - ' from ' bbb - ' . concurrently , the ratings have been placed on creditwatch with developing implications . the rating action reflects the nov . 28 , 2001 downgrade of enron corp . - - which supports yosemite securities co . - - which was prompted by standard & poor ' s concerns about the viability of the merger agreement with dynergy inc . and the liquidity implications of the possible failure of that transaction . yosemite securities ' creditwatch developing situation reflects the possibility that enron corp .

Subject: linear programming software purchase vince , i ' d like to purchase some copies of the xpress lp solver for the gas storage optimization model . we have previously discussed the purchase of cplex , but after trialing both systems , have found some worthwhile advantages with xpress . if others find planner / cplex best suited to their application , i see no problem is their use of a different system - both have strengths , and it is likely that i would use planner / cplex myself on some future project if we were to have both systems available . xpress is particularly suited to my application because it handles special ordered sets . this is a very efficient way of representing the storage ratchets as the integer search process is able to use the extra information provided by the set , rather than just using binary integer variables to represent the ratchets . planner is a c + + interface for cplex . it has some significant limitations , and does not permit access to all cplex features . dash optimization have made the following offer : all software purchases made by enron this year will be at 30 % off the list price - we do not need to make a single purchase of any specific quantity of licenses to obtain this discount . 90 days of full maintenance services will be provided with the purchase . the emosl utility will be provided at no cost . the xbsl system will be provided at no cost when it is released in a few weeks time . for the gas storage optimization model , i would like to purchase : one development license , hyper version , with modeller , primal / dual simplex , mip search , dlls , emosl and xbsl when available . list price $ 10 , 000 discounted price $ 7 , 000 two run time licenses for above , list price total $ 8 , 000 discounted price $ 5 , 600 total cost $ 12 , 600 i ' ve used the usually security request system to set the purchase process going , should you agree to this . tom .

Subject: anniversary hi , sistas - here ' s the scoop on the josephine house : we can reserve with just a credit card ; no deposit required . parties under 20 : $ 200 room fee . $ 50 valet parking fee . i confirmed " 17 " with mom . heidi sent some sample menus . a 3 - course menu ( appetizer or salad , entree , dessert ) is $ 45 . a 4 - course ( same as 3 - course plus hors d ' oeuvres ) sample menu is $ 52 . each menu could include a choice of three or four options per course . the food sounds really good . so , here ' s a guess at cost : 17 people at $ 45 = $ 765 beverages = $ 200 gratuity = $ 193 valet = $ 50 room rental = $ 200 total $ 1408 , or $ 469 per family if we divide it into thirds what do you guys think ? should we explore other options - or just go with this ? i think chris and i would be fine with this sort of cost - but probably couldn ' t go crazy with gift and decorations too . so , if we really want to do the photo ( s ) - do we have a cost for these yet ? , we may want to consider other options . thoughts ? - cara cara white community development coordinator usta texas section 1 - 888 - 883 - 6388 cwhite @ texas . usta . com

( news / quote ) worked yesterday to find ways to bolster confidence in enron ' s weakened energy - trading business as the companies ' negotiators continued talks on revising the terms of their merger , executives close to the talks said . the renegotiated deal would cut the value of the acquisition by half , they said , to roughly $ 4 billion . dynegy , they said , was also prepared to invest at least an additional $ 250 million in enron , on top of the $ 1 . 5 billion cash infusion from dynegy ' s biggest investor , chevrontexaco , included in the initial deal announced nov . 9 . but dynegy wants the new cash backed by hard assets , and the companies were trying to identify and value enough enron holdings not already mortgaged to other creditors , the executives said . before a series of financial disclosures sent enron ' s stock into collapse and the company into the arms of dynegy , its houston rival , enron ' s natural gas and electricity trading floors did more business than the two largest competitors combined . they also accounted for the majority of enron ' s profits by far . but traders and wall street analysts said the business had steadily deteriorated amid questions about the depths of enron ' s financial straits . many traders have curtailed dealings with enron , and the executives close to the talks said dynegy officials scouring enron ' s books were having difficulty this week figuring out how much cash the trading operation was generating . the executives close to the talks said that the renegotiated terms for dynegy ' s acquisition of enron would lower the price to about 0 . 13 dynegy share for each share of enron , cutting by half the value of the deal announced nov . 9 , when dynegy offered 0 . 2685 share . if a deal is struck at 0 . 13 dynegy share , at yesterday ' s closing prices , dynegy would be paying about $ 5 . 32 an enron share , a 29 . 4 percent premium over enron ' s diminished stock price . the premium was 20 . 6 percent over enron ' s closing price on the day that the deal was announced . both companies are seeking promises from enron ' s bank lenders to extend debt repayment dates until after the merger closes . and they are also discussing adding provisions that could limit dynegy ' s ability to back out of the combination . the two companies are also working to arrange a cash infusion of $ 500 million from j . p . morgan chase ( news / quote ) and citigroup ( news / quote ) that would provide enron with desperately needed new cash . but there is growing concern that the cash infusion from the banks will not calm investors ' fears or reassure energy traders , leading dynegy to seek an additional $ 500 million in cash for enron . late yesterday , the two companies were hung up over whether enron , which has already used many of its most prized assets as collateral for loans , has enough assets left to serve as collateral for the additional money , according to executives close to the talks . a number of enron assets were being examined , including some that have already been used to obtain other loans , the executives said . the assets include : transwestern pipeline , a major natural gas pipeline that links the gas - producing basins of texas and the southwest with california ; enron ' s stake in other gas - pipeline assets ; its 9 . 8 percent stake , worth about $ 400 million , in eog resources ( news / quote ) , a former subsidiary that is now an independent publicly traded oil and gas company ; and its indirect stake in hanover compressor , which manufactures equipment used to increase the pressure of natural gas and facilitate its flow on interstate pipelines . yesterday , investors anxiously awaited a report by moody ' s investors service , which like other major credit - rating firms , currently ranks enron ' s debt at the lowest investment - grade level . if enron were to lose its investment - grade status , it could be forced to repay or refinance up to $ 3 . 9 billion in debt , while other traders would probably further curtail business . but by late yesterday , moody ' s ( news / quote ) decided not to issue a statement after receiving assurances from enron and dynegy officials that a renegotiated deal would be announced soon , the executives said . a moody ' s spokesman declined comment . executives close to the talks said that they hoped that new cash from dynegy would reassure both wall street and the energy - trading markets that enron ' s trading floor would survive and remain a valuable asset . but analysts and investors are having difficulty figuring how much value the trading operation has already lost , and how much the business has been reduced because of credit concerns . " i believe dynegy is probably seeing that deterioration in the core business and wants to renegotiate the purchase price as a result , " said andre meade , head of united states utilities research for commerzbank securities in new york . " i don ' t think anyone can estimate the earning power of enron over the next three to four quarters , and i ' m not sure enron has a good estimate . " mr . meade said he did not believe that dynegy ' s earlier estimate that the acquisition would add 90 cents a share to its earnings was " reliable today , given how sharply the business seems to have deteriorated . " by mr . meade ' s calculations , if enron ' s trading volumes were to fall 50 percent next year - even if normal volume growth levels returned in 2003 - that would wipe out nearly all the value in the stock . karen denne , an enron spokeswoman , said the company had experienced a decline in energy trading volume and in the number of traders doing business with it , but both stabilized yesterday . she declined to elaborate or quantify the decline . she also said that enron ' s trading operation remained profitable , though she could not quantify it , and she also said she did not know whether the company was working on a possible bankruptcy filing or other contingency plans should its business and liquidity worsen . " we ' re moving forward with the merger , " she said . dynegy officials did not return telephone calls yesterday . shares of enron rose yesterday on news of a possible revised acquisition agreement . they closed at $ 4 . 11 , up 2 . 5 percent , or 10 cents . shares of dynegy closed at $ 40 . 89 , up 4 . 2 percent , or $ 1 . 64 . though yesterday ' s gains halted a four - day slide in enron shares , the stock is down 95 percent this year after disclosures of major losses as well as significant accounting errors that led enron to admit it overstated profits during the last five years by nearly $ 600 million . now , difficulties within enron ' s trading operation are exacerbating the company ' s overall liquidity problems in three ways , according to some analysts and rival energy - trading executives . first , other traders are requiring enron to put up greater margin on its trades . on top of that , in some cases enron ' s traders are being forced to pay more to buy natural gas than traders at other companies . this credit premium in some transactions has ranged from 3 cents to 6 cents for every million british thermal units of gas enron buys , these people say . additionally , many traders , like the mirant corporation ( news / quote ) , have either scaled back or stopped doing business with enron , hurting its trading revenue . mr . meade of commerzbank said " end - use customers and trading counterparties appear to be shifting their business to competitors as a result of enron ' s credit concerns and are reluctant to increase their exposures to enron .

' this is clearly a hard problem ( e . g . does this just mean response - time measurement , can it be done by passive means , how should the measurements be presented , etc . ) . in short - rtfm provides a good distributed measuring system for traffic volumes - ippm has concentrated on transport - layer behaviour of the current , best - effort internet . - rmonmib is beginning to consider application - layer measurement

" the market is really shrugging off this news , " said mark donahoe , a managing director at u . s . bancorp piper jaffray . upbeat earnings news from american express , released monday afternoon , seemed to give stocks an additional lift . investors may be shifting their focus away from concerns about anthrax exposure and u . s . military maneuvers in afghanistan to take a closer look at quarterly earnings results , said steven kroll sr . , managing director at monness , crepsi & hardt . the uncertainty on the global front " looks like it is going to be a long , drawn - out affair , " mr . kroll said . " i think stocks will revert back to being earnings - driven . " although dismal by ordinary standards , last week ' s flood of quarterly earnings reports got a reasonably upbeat reception from investors , who seem to have approached them with extremely low expectations . " the markets acted pretty well last week in light of some very ugly earnings , " said mr . donahoe of u . s . bancorp . that resilience might be giving hope to investors this week , he added . still , investors will be carefully sifting through quarterly results in the coming week to get a fix on how the fourth quarter is shaping up , mr . kroll argued . third - quarter earnings showed several pockets of strength on monday , with big companies such as minnesota mining and manufacturing and u . s . steel posting results that met or topped analysts ' estimates . the dow industrials got an additional boost shortly after 2 p . m . edt when index component american express reported earnings that , excluding certain items , beat wall street previously lowered estimates . the financial - services concern posted net income of $ 298 million , or 22 cents a share , down 60 % from $ 737 million , or 54 cents a share , a year earlier . excluding charges related to a corporate restructuring and the september 11 attacks , american express said it would have earned $ 595 million , or 45 cents a share , for the latest quarter . analysts had been expecting earnings of 30 cents a share , according to thomson financial / first call . shares of american express surged after the quarterly earnings release , closing up 3 . 4 % at $ 30 . 32 . chip stocks helped lead the nasdaq composite higher , with the philadelphia semiconductor index gaining 5 . 4 % . the rally seemed to be a continuation of friday ' s gains in the sector , sparked by positive earnings news from kla - tencor . u . s . steel , the nation ' s no . 1 steelmaker , said it swung to a third - quarter loss from a profit a year earlier , hurt by oversupply and a weak economy . but excluding charges related to the closure of one mill and damage at another , u . s . steel said its loss was much narrower than what was forecast by analysts surveyed by thomson financial / first call . shares of u . s . steel rose 9 . 7 % to $ 14 . 74 . investors also sent 3 m shares nearly 5 % higher after the maker of chemical and adhesive products squeaked by wall street estimates , despite a 21 % decline in net income . and oil producers conoco and usx - marathon group handily beat analysts ' forecasts . but not all the earnings news was cheery . local phone company sbc communications recorded net income that was slightly below estimates . shares of sbc , a component of the dow industrials , fell 5 . 1 % to $ 41 . 40 . meanwhile , the outlook for corporate profits in the fourth quarter seems discouraging , some analysts noted . on monday , 3 m guided wall stret ' s earnings expectations lower for the upcoming quarter , and a top executive at u . s . steel told analysts that the company ' s fourth quarter would be " difficult . " companies " are meeting third quarter expectations , but they are talking down the fourth quarter , " said mr . kroll of monness crespi & hardt . he said that some of the rise in monday ' s markets might be a carryover from friday ' s buying activity related to the expiration of u . s . stock option and index option contracts , an event known as " double witching . " one of the hardest - hit stocks on monday was enron , an energy concern that said that the securities and exchange commission was seeking information about certain complex transactions it undertook with a limited partnership organized by its chief financial officer . shares of enron plunged 21 % to $ 20 . 65 . overseas , stocks closed higher . london ' s financial times - stock exchange 100 - share index gained 1 . 1 % , while frankfurt ' s xetra dax index rose 2 % . earlier in the day , japan ' s nikkei 225 average closed with a gain of 0 . 3 % , but hong kong ' s hang seng index ended 0 . 3 % lower . in economic news , the conference board reported that its index of leading indicators for the month fell 0 . 5 % in september , matching the estimates of economists surveyed by thomson global markets . the index - - a composite of measurements aimed at forecasting likely changes in the economy - - included some data gathered after the sept . 11 attacks . the decline , which was the index ' s largest one - month drop since january 1996 , confirmed that the widespread weakness in the u . s . economy is deepening , the conference board said . falling stock prices and rising initial unemployment claims were two of the index components that contributed most negatively to the september reading . in august , the leading - indicators index slipped 0 . 1 % , less than the previous estimate of a 0 . 3 % decline . even so , the back - to - back declines paint a bleak economic picture , said conference board economist ken goldstein . the two - month decline in the index suggests that the already - weak economy is likely to remain weak into next year , mr . goldstein said . the overall reading from these numbers indicates that manufacturing and services are experiencing a significant slowdown . in major u . s . market action : stocks rose . on the big board , where 1 . 09 billion shares were traded , 1 , 813 stocks rose and 1 , 291 fell . on the nasdaq , 1 . 49 billion shares changed hands . bonds were mixed . the 10 - year treasury note rose less than 1 / 16 point monday , or 62 . 5 cents for each $ 1 , 000 invested . the yield , which moves inversely to its price , fell to 4 . 618 % . the 30 - year bond fell 1 / 16 point to yield 5 . 364 % . the dollar rose . the dollar bought 122 . 56 yen , compared with 121 . 20 yen late friday . the euro traded at 89 . 18 u . s . cents , down from 89 . 84 cents late friday . copyright ( c ) 2001 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . copyright ?

" related party transactions " is the heading used by enron in its 1999 and 2000 annual reports to discuss dealings with its limited partnerships , ljm cayman lp and the larger ljm 2 co - investment lp , which engaged in complex hedging transactions involving company assets worth hundreds of millions of dollars . fastow severed his ties to the partnerships in june . ljm was set up in june 1999 for energy - related investments , and ljm 2 in december 1999 for energy - and communication - related investments . the journal reported $ 35 million of its third - quarter loss of $ 638 million were connected with the limited partnerships curt launer , an analyst at credit suisse first boston , said investors should question enron ' s use of real value accounting when the value of certain assets , " most notably in telecommunications , " have declined precipitously . " investors have had several opportunities to question enron ' s credibility and at each of those turns the share price has declined , " launer said . some analysts , though , cautioned against assuming fire when there might only be smoke .

' s ratings on rating watch negative by fitch . the rating of the marlin ii notes is supported by an overfund account ( pre - funded interest ) and equity commitment from enron in the form of mandatorily convertible preferred stock . the overfund account is invested in enron debt securities ( rated ' bbb + ' , rating watch negative ) , with payments used to service interest to noteholders . payment of principal ultimately relies on enron ' s obligation to remarket mandatorily convertible preferred securities . fitch currently rates enron ' s preferred securities ' bbb - ' , rating watch negative . in addition , the transaction also benefits from rights under a $ 125 million loan to azurix europe limited , rated ` bbb + ' by fitch . similarly , the rating of the osprey i notes is based on the support from the assets in the share trust used to support interest payments and an equity commitment from enron to remarket mandatorily convertible preferred stock to fund principal payments . the mandatorily convertible preferred stock has been issued and is being held in the share trust . the assets in the share trust supporting interest payments include enron unsecured obligations ( the overfund account ) as well as quarterly dividend payments on the mandatorily convertible preferred stock . while various sources of repayment exist , such as sale or liquidation of the underlying assets or an equity offering , in each case primary credit support is derived from the enron obligation to remarket mandatorily convertible preferred stock if an amount sufficient to repay the notes has not been deposited with the trustee the 120 - day prior to the maturity date , which is one of the note trigger events . in the event that the issuance of the preferred stock yields less than the amount required to redeem the senior notes , enron is required to deliver additional shares . if enron cannot or does not deliver on this obligation , subject to certain standstill periods , then the amount of the deficiency becomes a payment obligation of enron , representing a general unsecured claim . additional note trigger events include a downgrade of enron ' s senior unsecured debt below investment grade by any of the major rating agencies in conjunction with specified declines in enron ' s closing stock price over three consecutive trading days , as well as customary events of default under the notes . it is important to note that enron has not verified that the underlying assets have adequate market value to fully pay down the associated debt . fitch will continue to monitor these transactions in conjunction with the ratings of enron , corp . and will update investors as appropriate . enron ' s debt falls as company draws down on bank loans 10 / 26 / 2001 capital markets report ( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones & company , inc . ) new york - ( dow jones ) - enron corp .

" it was an administrative snafu , " said peggy mahoney , a spokeswoman for enron . " it ' s fixed . it ' s no big deal . we didn ' t get the paperwork in [ on time ] because it got sent to the wrong desk . it was taken care of on friday . " according to the letter , a nepool participant faces termination if it has failed to meet its bonding requirements three times over the previous 12 months . " having three defaults to trigger that letter does not happen frequently , " said ellen foley , an iso new england spokeswoman . in the letter , iso ' s chief financial officer , edward mckenna , said his organization " has been in contact with enron energy services through multiple telephone communications , and to date the financial assurance has not been cured . " but mahoney said enron never received written notification of its previous " financial assurance " defaults , which were corrected almost immediately . therefore , she said , the company was unaware that the current default was the third , which begins the expulsion proceeding . in addition , she said , the current default notice was sent to the wrong person , creating the delay that resulted in the letter . " we ' re working with iso new england to figure that out , " she said . the recommended termination is an embarrassment to enron because the firm ' s director of state government affairs , daniel w . allegretti , is the chairman of nepool ' s participant committee , which organizes and oversees the major membership meetings in the organization . " this is not that unusual within the pool , " said allegretti . " i frequently receive notices of technical defaults . " as far as posting the new bond to correct the situation , he said , " we were two and a half days late in submitting paperwork . " the incident also comes at a particularly sensitive time for enron . the parent in houston has been the subject of a financial scandal in which the firm ' s chief financial officer , andrew s . fastow , is accused of profiting from partnerships he oversaw that engaged in billions of dollars of transactions with enron . the securities and exchange commission is probing those transactions , the company said monday . enron placed fastow on leave tuesday and installed a new cfo . enron ' s stock has plunged amid ongoing revelations about the partnerships and their impact on the company ' s financial strength . the company reduced shareholder equity by $ 1 . 2 billion after terminating transactions by one of the partnerships that had been headed by fastow , according to the wall street journal . enron lost $ 618 million in the third quarter . yesterday , enron ' s shares closed at $ 16 . 35 , down 6 cents , on volume of 39 . 1 million shares . jeffrey krasner can be reached by e - mail at krasner @ globe . com . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . front page - companies oct 26 , 2001 by julie earle and sheila mcnulty enron has put up a page on its website of " frequently asked questions " in response to a barrage of analysts ' enquiries following last week ' s controversial results announcement . unfortunately , the us energy group ' s critics have not been satisfied with the answers . nor has wednesday ' s decision to replace andrew fastow , its chief financial officer , quelled all investors ' concerns about its highly complex financial affairs . however , analysts are pleased that kenneth lay , chief executive officer , is distancing the group from mr fastow and his ties to controversial financing vehicle " partnerships " . " it is a step in the right direction and we are happy to see them move , " says ronald barone of ubs warburg . " it ' s not the end of it . " the shares , which have tumbled since last week ' s results , ended a shade lower yesterday , off 0 . 37 per cent at dollars 16 . 35 . but analysts warn that the shares will continue to languish well below the 52 - week high of dollars 84 . 87 until the group improves its transparency . one of the frequently asked questions following enron ' s results announcement on october 16 concerned " a dollars 1 . 2 bn ( pounds 840 m ) reduction in shareholders ' equity " . the dollars 1 . 2 bn was not explained in the news release on the results , but mentioned in passing by mr lay in a follow - up conference call . many analysts confused it with a dollars 1 . 01 bn charge in the earnings report . it has since been called a " loss " and a " write - off " and enron ' s staff have struggled to explain it in plain language . enron ' s official position now is that the reduction in shareholders ' equity related to a structured finance vehicle in which ljm , a private equity fund formed by mr fastow , was an investor . when the decision was made to terminate these vehicles , enron " recorded a dollars 1 . 2 bn reduction in shareholders ' equity and a corresponding reduction in receivables . these adjustments were the result of enron ' s termination of obligations to deliver enron shares in future periods " . the confusion over the dollars 1 . 2 bn has further undermined the credibility of enron , which is now the subject of an unofficial inquiry by the securities and exchange commission . analysts were upset they did not know the adjustment was in the offing and note that it could be seen as increasing the group ' s debt ratio , which might hurt its debt rating . mr lay held an analysts ' meeting to counter charges that enron was not transparent . but this ended with demands for daily calls with outside auditors to explain its accounts . " i find the disclosure is not complete enough for me to understand and explain all the intricacies of these transactions , " said goldman sachs ' david fleischer . other analysts are also concerned about potential further write - offs . salomon smith barney ' s raymond niles points to enron ' s investments in its dabhol indian power plant , its south american investments , and its remaining telecoms assets . most importantly , he says , they may include several of enron ' s other off - balance - sheet vehicles . " frankly , we have not been able to get enough information on them to evaluate whether there is a problem with them , " mr niles says . other us energy traders have been distancing themselves from their rival . el paso said it was facing " a lot of questions on its accounting practices " . additional reporting by julie earle enron in turmoil : www . ft . com / enron copyright : the financial times limited enron bonds fall as company taps $ 3 bln credit line ( update 3 ) 2001 - 10 - 26 14 : 26 ( new york ) enron bonds fall as company taps $ 3 bln credit line ( update 3 ) ( adds egan - jones lowering credit rating in 12 th paragraph . ) houston , oct . 26 ( bloomberg ) - - enron corp . bonds and shares fell after the company failed to reassure investors its bond rating wouldn ' t be lowered and tapped a $ 3 billion credit line because it can no longer borrow in the commercial paper markets . enron ' s stock has fallen 52 percent in the past 10 days after investors questioned the company ' s transactions with affiliated companies run by its former chief financial officer . the stock fell 45 cents to $ 15 . 90 in early afternoon trading today . ` ` people are questioning the credibility of management , ' ' said john cassady , who helps manage $ 3 billion of fixed income assets at fifth third bancorp . ` ` it looks like the guy who was supposed to do everything for the benefit of shareholders was running partnerships for the benefit of himself .

Subject: alliance info alert : ferc report on western markets at its special meeting today , ferc released the results of its eagerly awaited probe into california ' s summer power crisis , concluding that under certain circumstances , california ratepayers were subjected to unjust and unreasonable power rates due to california ' s " seriously flawed " market structure and rules in conjunction with tight demand and supply conditions throughout the west . the ferc staff report on western markets and the causes of the summer 2000 price abormalities , entitled , part i of staff report on u . s . bulk power markets , is available at the following website : in response , ferc issued an order proposing a series of sweeping structural changes to the california iso and px to help remedy the pricing problems , and solicited public comment by november 22 . a technical conference has also been scheduled for november 9 , to discuss the proposed solutions and other remedies that might be suggested ( details tba ) . while all four commissioners supported the order , the order stretched the commission . chairman hoecker and comm . breathitt expressed strong endorsements , while comms . hebert and massey concurred , citing areas where they felt the commission had either " over - reached " or not gone far enough , as discussed below . a final order is expected to be issued by year ' s end . at the same time , the commission warned california consumers of their continued risk of paying higher prices unless policy makers there resolve state issues , such as : ( 1 ) immediately implementing the availability of day ahead markets for power purchases ; ( 2 ) development of demand responses ; ( 3 ) siting of generation and transmission ; and ( 4 ) assurance of sufficient reserve requirements . highlights of proposed california structural remedy in its order , ferc proposed a series of market overhauls , including : ( 1 ) eliminating the state ' s mandatory requirement that the state ' s investor - owned utilities buy and sell electricity through the px , and allowing these utilities to purchase electricity through forward contracts and other alternative mechanisms to manage supply risks . ( 2 ) requiring market participants to schedule 95 percent of their transactions in the day - ahead market and instituting a penalty charge for under - scheduling ( in excess of five percent of hourly load requirements ) , in order to discourage over - reliance on the real - time spot market . ( 3 ) establishing independent , non - stakeholder governing boards for the iso and px . ( 4 ) modifying the current single price auction system by ( a ) imposing a temporary $ 150 / mwh " soft cap " that prohibits supply bids in excess of $ 150 from setting the market - clearing price for all bidders ; ( b ) requiring sellers bidding above $ 150 / mwh to report their bids to ferc on a confidential , weekly basis and provide certain cost support ; and ( c ) requiring the iso and px to report monthly information on such bids . the commission ' s price mitigation measures would remain in effect through december 31 , 2002 . ( 5 ) declining to order retroactive refunds for the state ' s ratepayers and utilities , citing insufficient authority to do so , but subjecting sellers to potential refund liability for transactions from october 2 , 2000 until december 21 , 2002 , but no lower than their marginal or opportunity costs , if ferc finds non - competitive behavior . ( 6 ) encouraging accelerated state siting approval and introduction of demand response management programs . separately , the draft order rejected the iso ' s request for an extension of its current purchase price cap authority , and the px ' s request for price capping authority . commissioner responses comm . herbert reluctantly concurred , noting that his decision may change when a final order is considered based on comments filed or testimony offered at the november 9 meeting . he stressed that he would have preferred that the order address four areas : ( 1 ) eliminate all price controls in california markets ; ( 2 ) abolish the single price auction entirely ; ( 3 ) terminate the " buy and sell " mandate in the px ; and ( 4 ) direct the iso to address a long list of cited problems in its january 2001 rto filing , rather than having the commission prescribe specific remedies . hebert stated that while he was opposed in principle to the " soft cap " concept , if one had to be adopted , then the soft cap should increase incrementally increase over time at specific pre - announced dates . he believes that this would serve to both encourage greater investment in facilities and additional forward contracting as well as provide an incentive for california regulators to address market design and other flaws . also , he would not have disbanded the stakeholder governing boards at this time , but allow the iso and px to address this issue in their january 2001 rto filings . in addition , he would not dictate risk management methods , preferring instead that market participants determine appropriate actions on their own . finally , he advised californians not to be so environmentally focused that they do not realize their tremendous need for generation capacity . comm . breathitt stated her approval of the order while warning that ferc cannot allow the events of this past summer to reverse or slow the progress towards open and competitive markets . she noted that it was the commission ' s job to guide the market to self - correct and not to conduct " command and control . " she also commended the managers of the iso and px , saying that they have performed admirably . however , she noted she is awaiting comments on the single price auction remedy and its accompanying confidential reporting requirements . comm . massey concurred , but emphasized that he advocates a more aggressive approach . he feels that the congress has " put its thumb on the scale " in the federal power act to protect consumers . stating that prices will continue to be unreasonable in the future , he believes that this order moves in the right direction , by proposing solutions to identified problems such as an over reliance on the spot market , lack of demand response , the need to reconstitute governance of the iso and px and the elimination of the buy / sell mandate . comm . massey specifically called for comments regarding whether the $ 150 / mwh soft cap went far enough , whether ferc has the legal authority to issue refunds and to determine whether there should be a requirement for a certain percentage of forward contracting to hedge against the spot market price volatility . finally , chairman hoecker stated his strong support of the order , but noted that this is " no time to pull punches . " he emphasized that the commission needed frank comments from the industry . he echoed comm . breathitt ' s warning that competition is at risk and that they needed to get the markets back on track . noting that the commission lacked authority to order refunds , he stated that the responsibility rests with congress . addressing jurisdictional issues , he stated that siting problems encountered at the state level are slowing the " meandering transition " to competition . he feels that the state of california and ferc need to work together to resolve these problems and that ferc is not attempting to usurp power . rather , california is part of a broader interstate market and is dependent on the western region for reliable energy , thus placing the burden on federal action to make things work , hoecker maintained . the chairman also said that the commission will fully investigate and act upon complaints of market power abuse or further evidence provided by staff ' s ongoing investigation . if you have any questions or comments , please call jack cashin at 202 / 508 - 5499 .

Subject: re : eprm article chris , this is very well written and will serve the reader well . a few comments . 1 . when i think about the taxonomy of the var models , i typically use the classification based on 3 categories : a . variance / covariance method b . historical simulation c . monte carlo simulation . delta approach is the way of representing a position in a nonlinear instrument . 2 . i would define monte carlo as an approach based on statistical simulation of behavior of all the market prices / rates , etc . , and revaluation of the entire portfolio . the revaluation may be based on an approximation ( using taylor ' s expansion ) that may involve delta , delta / gamma , delta / gamma / omega or may be exact ( based on the same model that produces the mark - to - market portfolio valuations ) . the main benefit of using the mc simulation in the energy markets is the ability to capture the gapping behavior of the energy markets in a straightforward way . i would emphasize that there are attempts to incorporate jumps in the v / c model ( i shall send you the references from home ) . 3 . i would mention that historical simulation may break down in the markets that are evolving quickly ( new instruments for which we have no comparable prices , behavior of prices may change as markets mature or de - mature ) . 4 . for bigger portfolios , virtually all methods require some level of aggregation into atomic , elemental instruments to reduce the dimensionality of the problem . this process may be a source of a big error . 5 . the computational burden of mc can be reduced through clever preprocessing of a portfolio that introduces no error . many swaps with the same underlying can be aggregated into one positions ( they are portfolios of forwards and they are linear instruments ) . please , feel free to use any comment ( or none ) . vince " chris strickland " on 08 / 28 / 2000 02 : 58 : 56 pm please respond to " chris strickland " to : cc : subject : eprm article dear vince , ? d you think you might be able to look at this in the next day or so ? robin is after something by the end of this week . ? best regards . ? chris . ? - eprm _ 01 _ var . doc

Subject: clickpaper . com confirming entity discussions over the last several days with legal and tax have resulted in a change to the legal entity we ' ll use for the " trading " portion of clickpaper . com activity . as long as our business model is a one to many model the decision is . . . . . . a . for click match activity clickpaper . com can still be used as planned . simply , we ' ll only be invoicing for transaction fees . b . for click trade activity the following will happen . 1 . physical trading that occurs at any north american hub developed by clickpaper . com , enron north america , corp . ( ena ) will be the confirming entity . i have asked legal to develop a simple recital statement for the physical confirmation to indicate that the transaction originated as a " clickpaper . com on - line transaction " . 2 . physical trading that occurs at any hub developed for the u . k . , latin america , or asia , has not yet been finalized for legal entity purposes . my desire is that we follow the legal entity structure used by eol on - line trading for hubs in similar countries . we ' ll work that out soon . strictly from an operational point of view the benefits are many but the most significant is a much simplified mid / back - office effort in order to support clickpaper on - line business . we no longer need to be concerned about setting up more portfolio / book i . d . ' s for risk books as on - line deals can go into the same risk books used today for pulp and paper . intercompany transactions between clickpaper . com and ena are now eliminated for on - line trades which simplifies the confirmation support as well as the downstream financial reporting / reconcilation activity that would be required by using clickpaper . com as the entity . if our one to many model is successful , we move to a many to many model . at that point , all of this changes . so for now , enjoy ! for now , jeff harbert

Subject: re : regrouping of enw budget discussions wes and team had preset the meeting schedule and topics to be covered in each . the outline that i sent you with the changes for the remainder of this week is simply our best attempt at fitting coordinating topics around people availability and the meeting schedule that had already been set . the schedule that we have been working with that wes provided did not allocate two hours for the friday meeting . if you had set aside two hours , that had not been communicated to us . there were only two one - hour meeting slots on that schedule . one for enw from 1 - 2 and one for research from 3 - 4 . i have a major conflict on friday - i committed months ago to attend a meeting that ken lay asked to be involved in that is in the woodlands that runs through the evening hours . . only because beth perlman is out on thursday for a religious holiday , i decided to " skip out " from this meeting to be here on friday afternoon to discuss the operations and it development budgets together . in order to minimize my time away from the woodlands meeting , i orchestrated the time swap with vince kaminiski so that we could have our enw meeting at 3 : 00 . i will talk with you later today and fill you in on the commitment for ken lay . maybe we can work together for a scheduling solution that works for both of us . i would appreciate your help on that , louise . scheduling issues aside , wes suggested that we also review with you the ees budget that enw has prepared . our approach so far has been to determine the appropriate and necessary spend for 2002 for expense and capital for all of the services that enw provides to support the ees business . we have done this without regard to who will cover which expenses - ees or ea . that is a separate issue from understanding the services that need to be provided and our best estimate at costs . we are prepared , however , with a suggested split on the costs for discussion purposes . i have assumed that the decision on cost sharing or allocation would be made between the offices of the chair for ees and enw . if you would like to cover all of enw ' s budgets together , both for ees and ea , then it would make more sense to set a longer block of time ( maybe 3 hours ? ) . i will bring my schedule to our meeting at 11 : 00 today to cover the canadian budget and we can work out a schedule that works for both of us . we will be prepared to discuss pricing per transaction , but will hold that until the end of our meetings when we have been able to review with you the components of costs and the detail of capital projects . our review of costs and projects in effect will serve as our " scope of engagement " discussion . a service provider would never quote a firm price until agreement had been reached on the scope of the engagement . we will have a straw man for discussion on that . - - sally - - - - - original message - - - - - from : kitchen , louise sent : wednesday , september 26 , 2001 8 : 23 am to : beck , sally cc : piper , greg ; pickering , mark ; colwell , wes ; killen , faith ; roper , kerry ; schoppe , tammie ; valdez , christina subject : re : regrouping of enw budget discussions i am expecting an all in cost for this service - what do we achieve in separation . i had allocated two hours on friday to do this from lpm until 3 pm . are you not intending an all in cost ( per transaction ) of it and operations ?

Subject: iso new england and pjm propose standard market design message sent from the pjm - customer - info mailing list at pjm - customer - info @ majordomo . pjm . com : iso new england and pjm interconnection propose a standard market design for wholesale electricity markets march 29 , 2001 - holyoke , ma - two of the country ' s leading wholesale electricity market administrators , iso new england inc . and pjm interconnection , l . l . c . , together with alstom esca corporation , a systems developer for electric utilities , today announce their intent to formalize an agreement that will not only standardize their electricity markets , but will lead , they believe , to the standardization of wholesale electricity markets across the country . today , iso new england delivered a letter to the chairman and commissioners of the federal energy regulatory commission ( ferc ) , enclosing a report concerning its proposed comprehensive wholesale market program that combines salient features of the pjm market model with elements of its own existing wholesale market design . the combination would create a standardized wholesale market structure called the standard market design for wholesale electricity markets ( " standard market design " ) . iso new england , alstom esca and pjm , acting through its wholly - owned subsidiary , pjm technologies inc . , have agreed to proceed with the negotiation of an agreement where iso new england will purchase the existing pjm market design and certain software components from alstom esca and pjm . the two isos and alstom esca will work together to create a standardized market design that includes solutions to reserve markets and a common solution to unit dispatch . " this new market standard should put into place the necessary market improvements more quickly and at a reduced cost than if we were to implement a customized market system for new england , " said william w . berry , chairman and acting ceo of iso new england . " now is the time to stop the experimentation . ultimately , we hope the standard market design will serve as the benchmark for wholesale electricity marketplaces across the country , if not around the world . " " pjm is very excited to further standardize a design for a competitive wholesale electricity market , " said phillip g . harris , chairman and ceo of pjm . " along with the progress in the implementation of the pjm west concept , this initiative will provide an even broader standardized market design . " this approach should further expedite the elimination of trading barriers across different markets and promote ferc ' s goal of creating a seamless marketplace . " we intend to continue to work with the new york iso on issues of mutual importance , " stated mr . berry . " this new market design , together with our efforts to address the market " seams " and other coordination issues , will eventually bring the three northeast iso markets closer together . " iso new england and the new york iso will continue to work together on these issues under a joint board resolution passed on january 16 , 2001 . " because of our geographic location , new york is in the center of the northeast markets , with iso new england , pjm and imo each on one of our borders . we support the continued elimination of barriers across northeast trading markets to develop a more seamless marketplace where everyone will benefit , " said william j . museler , president and ceo of the new york independent system operator . " the new york iso will continue to work with our neighboring markets to remove barriers to trading across the region and to move towards larger regional markets . " this proposed market design standard will be developed jointly with stakeholder input . iso new england will propose the standard market design to the new england conference of public utility commissioners and the new england power pool in a series of meetings next week . additional meetings will be conducted in the next few weeks . the standard market design for new england will be subject to ferc approval . " standardization requires consistent and reliable technology to facilitate a market ' s efficiency . a market that moderates price fluctuations and encourages investment based on an expected return is an efficient market - - and efficiency is the key to establishing market liquidity , " said alain steven , ceo of alstom esca . " in the future , this agreement will be viewed as a catalyst in establishing more robust electricity markets . " iso new england inc . is the not - for - profit corporation responsible for the day - to - day reliable operation of new england ' s bulk generation and transmission systems with an installed capacity of almost 26 , 000 megawatts . in addition to operating the bulk power grid , iso new england is the administrator of the region ' s wholesale electricity marketplace and the open access transmission tariff on behalf of the new england power pool . iso new england is based in holyoke , massachusetts . the pjm interconnection , l . l . c . , is an independent system operator , administering the pjm open access transmission tariff and operating the pjm energy markets and capacity markets . pjm currently administers the largest wholesale electricity market in the world and has a membership of more than 200 . it is headquartered in norristown , pennsylvania . pjm technologies , inc . is a wholly - owned subsidiary of pjm interconnection , l . l . c . , designed to respond to market opportunities by bringing cost - effective , reliable solutions to the energy marketplace . it was created to commercialize pjm ' s knowledge capital , experience , and proven success in electric energy markets , system operations , and applications development . # # # for more information about the new york iso , please call : steve sullivan , director of communications , 518 - 356 - 7605 . please do not reply to this message . if you have a question for pjm customer relations and training , please complete and submit this form : to unsubscribe from this list , send an e - mail to majordomo @ majordomo . pjm . com containing only the following line in the body of the e - mail : unsubscribe pjm - customer - info

Subject: new businesses in london : weather & insurance hi vince , talking to the staff in london , i heard that lynda clemmons and a few of the key weather desk members left to start their own business . i am hearing that london may gain more independence from houston and gain its own book and , interestingly , also having ideas about developing the insurance / insurance derivatives market . i therefore thought this might be a useful opportunity to formalise a gradual transfer of responsibility for weather deal pricing from joe to myself plus start talking to vasant about the new markets on the insurance side . i will call you later to discuss this with you . regards , anjam x 35383

Subject: re : approvals on monterrey expenditures dear georgeanne , i am surprised , and you can be sure that i try very hard to adhere to enron corporate treasury policies , which i haven ' t actually seen so far . as a matter of fact , max yzaguirre used to sign alatorre ' s expenses , and i was specifically told to do so , until further notice . now , let me tell you this is the wrong way of giving me notice . . . . by the way , april ' s expense report of alatorre was signed by max and properly documented . june ' s expense report of alatorre was signed by me , after being told to do so , and properly documented . july ' s expense report of alatorre is not signed by me . there is a lot of signing to do for the monterrey office , and i am also signing all the other expenses in the mexico city , such as : employee ' s salaries , rent , local telephones , copiers , office maintenance , long distance contract , petty cash , air tickets , car maintenance , and some other that might escape my mind . not to mention the eeim documentation for the vitro plant : there are about to enter into the country 100 trucks with equipment for the eeim power plant , for which i am the legal rep , and i have had to verify every single document i need to sign , with our legal counsel ( getting proper approval ) , plus service contracts , banking documents , and all the documentation with the authorities , such as energy regulatory commission , federal commission of electricity , secretary of energy , etc , all of those requiring proper authorization procedures , which i do follow . there are other corp . policies , like trading and risk management procedures that are clearly writtn and i do follow daily . so , i totally agree with you that adherence to enron ' s authorization policies are crucial , and not only to your internal control , but also for our business to have sustainability . however , i strongly believe that such policies should come from your area , and if here is a communication gap , we need to fill it immediately . your proposals sound very good , and i ask you to help us formalize the procedures and minimize the time we spend performing this duties , since it has become a burden to my commercial activities . in the meantime , please notify me ( differently , if possible ) if there are any other exceptions or special authorization procedures , in order to avoid this situation again . i am copying steve irvin , so that he knows he is back into this rewarding activity . best regards , jaime williams . georgeanne hodges / enron @ enronxgate 08 / 21 / 2001 10 : 01 pm to : jaime williams / na / enron @ enron cc : louise kitchen / enron @ enronxgate , wes colwell / enron @ enronxgate subject : approvals on monterrey expenditures jaime , while reviewing some recent expenditures out of the monterrey office it was noted that several checks signed by you did not have properly approved supporting documentation . the absence of properly approved documentation for expenditures is a violation of enron corporate treasury policies and enron north america standard operating procedure . specifically we found three expense reports which were reimbursed to mr . jaime alatorre for expenses from april to august , that were not authorized by anyone prior to the check being signed and released to mr . alatorre . i understand that a transition has been taking place involving you and steve irvin as a result of the departure of max yzaguirre and that confusion about proper authorizations during this transition probably led to this circumstance but i wanted to let you know that adherence to enron ' s authorization policies is crucial to our internal control structure and that violations will not be permitted . susan helton will soon be discussing with you the entire process of disbursing funds out of the monterrey and mexico city offices in an attempt to get the internal controls in this area consistent with those in other enron remote offices . i expect some of the major changes to be as follows : * mexico city petty cash account to be closed * two signatures to be required on all checks \ wires ; you and steve irvin * checks to be processed once a week only ( except emergencies ) which will help with the availability of you and steve * expense reports of jaime williams , jaime alatorre and steve irvin to be authorized by louise kitchen prior to being reimbursed please call me with any questions or concerns

Subject: re : progress steve , thanks a lot . i think that having the pseudo code will go a long way towards understanding how the system works and making sure that there are no bugs in translation of a business problem ( for example , complicated credit insurance deals with multiple triggers and conditionality ) into the code . regarding tanya ' s attitude . just a few points . 1 . i don ' t think she has the skills to do the system administrator ' s work and she does not have the necessary privileges . this explains why she keeps asking winston for help . it ' s not that the work is beneath her . 2 . some members of tanya ' s team came to me complaining about winston . he effectively told them to go away and work on the " research projects " and that he would take care of the it issues . i don ' t think that it ' s just tanya ' s issue , though i agree that a more outgoing personality would be helpful . 3 . the reality of this situation is that the internal customers beat on tanya and me whenever there is any performance problems and / or they intuitively disagree with the results of a run . they could not care less about the demarcation line between it and research . they also want tanya to sign off on the model and she cannot do it without full access to the code . the bottom line is that we are in full agreement : tanya and winston have to work as a team and i shall work on my end to make sure that it happens . credit is emerging as a critical issue for enron for the next few weeks and the system cannot fail . vince from : stephen stock / enron @ enronxgate on 01 / 11 / 2001 08 : 23 am to : vince j kaminski / hou / ect @ ect cc : subject : progress vince , i got feedback from the lunchtime research meeting that you were talking about some specific solutions to performance of it systems . . . in particular distributed processing . also i heard that you had concerns about the use of multiple languages etc . . . . both of these sound like what i was discussing with you on previous occasions . . . do you feel the need to discuss these further ? the multi - language issue isn ' t really that much of an issue , as the current system is 98 % java right now . although i am a big fan of c / c + + ( it is my main development skill ) , i am also very aware that java is a much more evolved and robust language . i had serious doubts about the performance , but i ' ve had a review conducted , and the results are showing the sun unix implementation to be nearly as fast and in some cases faster than c / c + + because of something they call hot - spot technology . ( its an instruction caching technique , i believe ) . the concerns i expressed to you , were really about how technical people justify the use of a language on the strength of a relatively meaningless metric like portability . on the issue of distributed processing . . . the original review i had conducted by our architecture group pointed to that as a solution , and as zhiyong wei is already working on global valuation project , winston is actively working with zhiyong to see if he can model the var architecture on that , and also to find a common valuation piece between the systems . i ' d like the opportunity to talk to you about these issues if you have some time over the next few days ? also , i sat in on the tanya / winston meeting yesterday and as per our discussion at the elevator , i attempted to help her argument by suggesting to all present that she was trying to perform triage on the code . . . i . e . seperating research domain problems from it problems . she said that stepping through code was the only real way in which she could get a feel for where performance bottlenecks were . i asked her how she would measure that , and she said she would instrument the code manually by inserting timing elements at strategic points . i mentioned that a profiling tool could probably do this job for her . tanya again said that stepping through code is the only way she can get an idea of the code , and that studying documentation wasn ' t enough . about 6 weeks ago , i commissioned a team to document the system down to psuedo - code level and will be able to provide this to you and your team soon . ( in fact i ' ve asked for a draft copy to be given to tanya right now ) , and winston is also working on a draft research / it " working together " document , which will identify how the exchange of information takes place . tanya also gave the impression that she wants a dedicated it developer to do all the environment setup for her , because she doesn ' t really want to have to do that . i think that this is probably the root cause of the issue . the it guys are working very hard and her handling of the situation is not good , as it gives the impression that this kind of work is beneath her . she is claiming that they are un - cooperative . . . . they are claiming that she continually asks the same questions about set - up over and over again , and doesn ' t seem to want to learn how to do it . winston on the other hand , could be more proactive in determining what is a business related model issue and an it issue and ask for help from research . i think you debbie and i need to work quite hard to get them to play nicely . i have asked tanya and winston to go ahead and work very closely together over the next few days . . . . and debbie brackett and i will review their progress on friday . in the meantime l ' ll be looking at setting up a working test environment that doesn ' t involve my main quant guys in day to to day setup issues as a longer term solution . regards steve

Subject: vitro project brian , it occurred to me that we haven ' t spoken about the ongoing management / oversite of the construction of the vitro project in light of next week ' s expected events . while we have discussed eeos ' s role with tractebel , we need to keep in mind that we need a technical person to monitor the construction process to protect enron ' s remaining 20 % interest . i believe steve irvin had planned on using robert rimbau . unsure if robert works for you or virgo , but regardless , enron needs someone to monitor the construction process . secondly , also keep in mind that we are technically still on the hook to be the operator of the project . while we are working with tractebel to transition out of the operating role , we haven ' t yet completed the transition . we want to make sure that we don ' t breach any agreement with the idb . let ' s talk as soon as possible to make sure that we have these issues adequately covered . we probably need to engage steve irvin as well . i am unsure of his status , but i will check with louise . thanks , don 713 - 529 - 6280 home 713 - 412 - 8967 cell

u = 5526 & m = 1402 , alternative url : warm weather and strong storage injections have temporarily shifted the focus in the gas market away from a potential supply shortage this winter toward a growing sense that supplies might just prove adequate . the result has been a steady and steep decline in the november nymex price from $ 5 . 63 per mmbtu on october 12 into the $ 4 . 60 s as of october 25 . cash prices have followed suit , falling from the mid - $ 5 . 50 s to the $ 4 . 60 s at the henry hub , and gas is now pricing below residual fuel oil in the gulf coast and especially on the east coast . although gas storage inventories will begin the winter at levels higher than expected , in cera  , s view adequate supply for the winter is not yet assured , and the market remains subject to a quick return to prices well above $ 5 . 00 with the first cold snap . storage injections of 71 billion cubic feet ( bcf ) for the week ended october 20 accompanied by broad - based and continuing warm weather have driven the shift in market psychology . last week  , s injection rate was 26 . 5 bcf , or approximately 3 . 8 bcf per day , above the previous five - year average for those seven days and 58 bcf above the 13 bcf of injections recorded last year for the week ending october 22 . with warm weather this week and the return of more normal temperatures expected next week , cera now expects storage to reach a maximum level of 2 , 784 bcf on october 31 - - still an all - time low entering the winter , by 26 bcf ( see table 1 ) . is this inventory level " enough " ? not yet . storage inventories this winter under 15 - year normal weather conditions would fall to approximately 780 bcf , 22 bcf above the previous all - time low . this end - of - march minimum implies total withdrawals in the united states this winter of 2 . 0 trillion cubic feet ( tcf ) , 128 bcf above last year  , s withdrawals . but holding withdrawals this winter down to 2 . 0 tcf in the face of a return to normal weather - - and the demand rebound of 3 . 0 bcf per day it would bring - - will be difficult . although the beginning of a us supply rebound and growing imports will add approximately 1 . 0 bcf per day to supplies this winter , holding withdrawals down requires both of the following : * industrial markets - - mainly ammonia and methanol producers - - that are now shut down because of high gas prices must remain shut down . these markets represent approximately 0 . 5 bcf per day of demand that could return , should gas prices moderate relative to ammonia and methanol . * the nearly 1 . 5 bcf per day of switchable load now burning residual fuel oil must remain off of gas . in cera  , s view , for gas prices to fall below resid on a sustained basis , particularly as power loads increase this winter , it must become apparent that winter demand can be met , the current resid load can return to gas , and storage inventories can be held reasonably near the previous record low . that low , 758 bcf , occurred in march 1996 and was accompanied by a february average price of $ 4 . 41 and a march average of $ 3 . 00 at the henry hub . that spring , however , us productive capability was nearly 4 . 0 bcf per day greater than it is today , winter power generation demand was lower , and there were about 4 . 5 million fewer residential and commercial gas customers in the united states . market fundamentals in cera  , s view still support gas prices above those of resid , which as of this writing is pricing in the $ 4 . 75 - $ 5 . 00 per mmbtu range . warm weather throughout november and into december could reverse this relationship , but a warm october alone is insufficient , and any cold weather within the next few weeks will quickly tighten the slack that has temporarily come into the market . cera  , s price outlook for november - - an average of $ 5 . 50 at the henry hub - - stands for now . * * end * * follow url for pdf version of this alert with associated table . cera ' s autumn 2000 roundtable event dates and agendas are now available at http : / / www . cera . com / event account changes to edit your personal account information , including your e - mail address , etc . go to : http : / / eprofile . cera . com / cfm / edit / account . cfm this electronic message and attachments , if any , contain information from cambridge energy research associates , inc .

Subject: contract numbers i am making good progress . i have met with mike , matt , bob , and jeff . it sounds like mike is done , the rest are close . i told each of them that this is a " fill or kill " bid . if they like it then we ' ll get done , if not then we can revisit at the end of their existing contracts . i also told each of them that if the market changes between now and then that it ' s their risk . i also said that if they value keeping their options open that they better figure out some way to monetize their theta as enron would not be in a position to make them whole for what they would have been paid had they chosen not to keep their options open . i still have a couple of issues . one is greg wolfe . i am thinking that his package should look quite similar to motley ' s . i need to show him numbers today and would like to talk with one or both of you about it before i talk to greg . i want to show him numbers for a two - year and a three - year contract . he is currently talking to aep , calpine , and arizona public service . he is asking for a lot of money to stay : base of 200 , signing of 100 , annual retention of 100 plus equity of 600 with a two year vest . he would also do a 3 year deal with equity of 800 with a three year vest . i have talked a little bit with mike s . about how important wolfe is to the northwest middle market effort . the answer was that he is really important because he knows all of the customers , he knows enron ' s internal process , and he is very good at working with mike to get deals executed and papered properly . having said that , mike said that he supports whatever decision i come up with in terms of retaining wolfe - - in other words , if he leaves then he leaves and mike is ok with that . i ' d like to talk to one of you this afternoon to hear your thoughts and ideas on this . i ' ll give you a call .

" for the insurance buyer , such exchange instruments would not represent the perfect risk transfer vehicle , but as long as they are quantifiable and indexable , they may represent a good surrogate , " he said . the exchanges could also be used to create a derivatives market for over - the - counter securitized deals , if there are regular issuers of catastrophe bonds , mr . lane said . the soft insurance market has also hindered the growth of exchange - based insurance products , said sean f . mooney , senior vp and chief economist at guy carpenter & co . , the reinsurance brokerage unit of marsh inc . in new york . " the traditional market has been so competitive that people are not looking for other ways of doing business , " he said . at least in concept , the exchange - based deals are generally similar to the mortgage - backed securities that have been a huge success since they were introduced in the 1970 s . " there is a belief that alternative means of transferring risks will grow , but it is difficult to predict when , " mr . mooney said . currently , the trading that is taking place typically involves established insurers and reinsurers , so the exchanges have not brought substantial new capacity to the marketplace , he said . guy carpenter provided the index for the bermuda commodities exchange reinsurance products . the bce did not take off , however , and was suspended last year after two years of little activity . the oldest of the insurance - related , exchange - based derivative products are the catastrophe options traded on the chicago board of trade , which began trading the options in 1996 . initially , there was substantial interest in the options , but the soft traditional market has hampered use of the contracts to hedge catastrophe exposures , said carlton purty , an independent broker at the cbot who trades in options . no catastrophe option trades have been completed at the cbot so far this year , he said . last year , there was increased interest in the contracts because of hurricane floyd , but few contracts were traded , mr . purty said . " i think a major , major catastrophe will have to happen before they really take off , " he said . the contracts offer real protection , and options dealers are keen to trade in a new niche , but the conventional insurance and reinsurance markets are so soft that few companies are turning to alternative coverage options , mr . purty said . the catastrophe risk exchange , located in princeton , n . j . , has radically changed its structure since it was originally announced in mid - 1996 , and it is well positioned to expand , said frank sweeney , chief operating officer . catex initially planned to be a computer - based facility for reinsurers that would enable them to exchange catastrophe risks and to build balanced portfolios . but by the time the exchange was operational in november 1996 , it was clear that most reinsurers and insurers interested in catex wanted only to buy and sell conventional reinsurance , mr . sweeney said . although there was some interest in risk swapping , only a handful of risks were posted on the system , and none was traded , mr . sweeney said . consequently , catex has become chiefly a " cash for cover " exchange , he said , noting that the risks reinsured on the exchange include property catastrophe coverage , aviation and liability coverages . catex also trades industry loss warranties , where coverage is triggered by an actual loss combined with an industry loss over an agreed threshold . other adjustments to the exchange included making it accessible through the internet in november 1998 . and late last year , catex offered users the ability to set up smaller networks , allowing them form groups whose members do business only with one another . since its inception , catex has completed about 450 trades , totaling $ 400 million in premium and more than $ 3 billion in limits , he said . catex ' s roughly 160 subscribers include reinsurers , insurers and corporate entities that purchase coverage through their captives , mr . sweeney said . " we obviously have a long way to go , but we are pretty satisfied with what we have achieved so far , " mr . sweeney said . the exchange sees increased activity after major losses , as cedents seek to buy replacement coverage to offset depletions in their existing cover , he said . for example , mr . sweeney said , there was a flurry of activity after the european windstorms in december last year . last september , the chicago mercantile exchange entered the field of insurance - related derivatives when it began offering weather derivatives . thus far , 420 futures contracts have been traded , said larry grannan , senior director in product marketing at the cme . such contracts are designed to allow businesses to hedge against weather - related losses . for example , a utility may sell less power in a mild winter , and it would be able to use the futures to hedge a resultant fall in revenues . the exchange first offered heat - based indexes for atlanta , chicago , cincinnati and new york . in january , it added philadelphia , dallas , des moines , las vegas , tucson and portland , and it began offering contracts based on cold weather . currently , most of the trades are between securities dealers themselves , but , eventually , the contracts will likely be used more extensively by utilities and insurers , mr . grannan said . in addition , the futures contracts could be used as hedges for over - the - counter securitized deals , he said . copyright , 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved .
Subject: interview - credit derivatives dear vince : thank you for the invitation yesterday . it was a pleasure to meet you all and learn more about the group , it ' s structure and to some extent what you are involved in . please extend my thanks to all of them . i am particularly interested in the credit swap trading platform that enron has recently started . such a platform will provide unique visibility into the credit markets . as you suggested i tried to learn more about this from tanya . i would like to learn more and if possible meet other people more directly linked to the effort . just simple instruments like credit swaps will require serious modelling capability for the pricing and the hedging of these apparently simple intruments . the market visibility i mention above can be explored through credit derivatives trading successfully if enron possesses superior ( vis a vis morgan stanley , salomon smith barney , chase manhatan , etc . ) modelling technology in credit derivatives . i can and would like to consider the possibility of doing this for enron . i would like to help develop and participate in putting together that business . as i mentioned to you i have done some work in credit derivatives and am deeply familiar with virtually all the work of the principal academics in credit derivatives namely : duffie , lando , tuffano , duffee , das , lelland , etc . i have read carefully most of their work ( published as well as working papers ) on the subject to date . i look forward to hearing from you . best regards joao

Subject: reliant to split itself into two publicly traded companies news briefs : reliant energy plans to form two public companies reliant energy said it plans to file with the texas public utility commission a business separation plan under which it would divide into two publicly traded companies to separate its unregulated businesses from its regulated businesses . the company plans an initial public offering of approximately 20 % of the common stock of its unregulated operations late this year or early in 2001 , assuming market conditions remain favorable . the company expects the ipo to be followed by a distribution to shareholders of the remaining stock of the unregulated company within 12 months . the remaining businesses , which are predominately regulated , will be structured as a holding company . the unregulated company will own reliant energy ' s unregulated power generation and related energy trading and marketing operations , its unregulated retail businesses , which currently include energy , telecommunications and internet services , and the company ' s european electric generating and trading / marketing operations . the plan also contemplates that in 2004 the unregulated company will receive from the regulated company cash equal to the market value of the regulated company ' s interest in its texas regulated generation operations . in addition , the unregulated company will have an option to purchase the regulated company ' s interest in these operations at a price equal to the market value . the regulated company will include reliant energy ' s electricity and natural gas companies , which serve about four million customers in the u . s . and include reliant energy hl & p / entex , reliant energy arkla , reliant energy entex and reliant energy minnegasco . other operations in the entity will include its u . s . interstate pipelines , its interests in latin america and , initially , its texas regulated generation .

( chewco got its name , says one person familiar with the matter , from the character chewbacca in the " star wars " movies , where jedi warriors also roamed . ) chewco bought from enron the jedi interest formerly held by calpers , according to documents and interviews . it couldn ' t be determined what the terms of that transaction were . however , the fact that chewco shows up as a debtor to jedi in the texas state filing suggests that money for the purchase was borrowed from jedi itself . the available information on the chain of transactions raises questions about how separate jedi and chewco really were from enron and whether jedi ' s assets and liabilities should have been folded into the company ' s financial statements . in a march 2000 sec filing , enron makes a brief reference to its new jedi partner , which enron doesn ' t identify but presumably is chewco . the filing said " an officer of enron has invested in the limited partner of jedi and from time to time acts as agent on behalf of the limited partner ' s management . " while the officer isn ' t named , the description is similar to that given for mr . kopper in relation to chewco in the ljm 2 offering memorandum . in march of this year , enron moved to purchase the balance of jedi that it didn ' t already own . in an sec filing earlier this year , enron said it acquired for $ 35 million " the limited partner ' s interests " in jedi . again , the partner wasn ' t named , but presumably was chewco . enron consolidated jedi ' s assets and liabilities into the company . the sec filing said jedi ' s holdings included 12 million shares of enron stock . enron said it also paid off about $ 620 million of jedi " third - party debt .

" we read the disclosure over and over and over again , and we just didn ' t understand it - - and we read footnotes for a living . " he says . but at the time , he concedes , " it was just an odd footnote to us . " he started telephoning analysts at wall street firms to determine what aspects of the bulls ' case he was missing . what he heard excited him further . part of the bullishness focused on enron ' s strategy of trading broadband - network capacity . mr . chanos , who already had placed bearish bets on some telecommunications bandwidth providers , was convinced that the industry already suffered from overcapacity and that the situation would only get worse . his conclusion : if enron " couldn ' t see the looming train wreck coming in telecom , what else were they missing ? maybe they weren ' t as infallible in the energy area as people had thought . " another warning signal was insider stock sales through the second half of 2000 , he says . that sat awkwardly with the common refrain from wall street analysts that investors had to just trust management given the difficulty of analyzing how earnings were derived . the company didn ' t immediately comment on the sales on friday . " you look for patterns in my business , " says mr . chanos . " the fact that this was a ` trust me ' story , while management was voting with its feet was another check . while we didn ' t have a smoking gun , we certainly saw a reason to perhaps not trust management at its word that these earnings were what they said they were . " those factors led mr . chanos to begin shorting the stock in late november of last year , when it was fluctuating between $ 65 and $ 80 ; he won ' t provide details . overall , the level of short interest , or short - selling positions not yet closed out , on enron shares jumped 2 . 2 million shares to 7 . 9 million shares for the month through mid december , from the same period in the previous month . as other red flags surfaced , in february mr . chanos and other short sellers significantly ramped up the bearish positions . mr . chanos first discussed his view of enron with those outside the firm that month in miami , where he hosted his annual " bears in hibernation " conference . attendees bring two ideas to present , and one of his was enron . with enron ' s stock trading at $ 72 at that time , or roughly 40 times 2001 ' s per - share earnings estimates , " the market is priced for perfection here , " mr . chanos told the 25 or so attendees , " whereas it looks like things may be anything but . " back in new york , mr . chanos arranged a second round of sessions with bullish analysts . " here ' s our thesis , " he told them . " what are we missing ? " mr . chanos came out of those meetings with a " heightened conviction that we were right . " for one thing , he sensed frustration brewing about the level of trust required with enron . as the spring progressed , mr . chanos became increasingly confident , adding to his short position . on a widely reported conference call in april , jeffrey skilling , then enron ' s chief executive , responded to another short seller ' s criticism that enron hadn ' t provided a balance sheet by calling him an " ah . " for the first time , " i got a sense that the company was now getting tough questions and was not happy about it , " mr . chanos says . for their part , wall street analysts argue that they have limited time and resources for the in - depth research that mr . chanos prefers . many cover dozens of companies . still , some say they have learned lessons from enron ' s fall from grace . salomon smith barney analyst raymond niles , for one , says he will " pursue warning signs relentlessly and go by gut instinct " when he senses a looming problem . says mr . niles , who covers enron : " i think shorts play a very valuable role in the market , reminding us of what can go wrong . " ( see related article : " auditor could face scrutiny on clarity of financial reports " - - wsj nov . 5 , 2001 ) copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . what enron ' s financial reports did - - and didn ' t - - reveal - - - auditor could face scrutiny on clarity of financial reports by jonathan weil staff reporter of the wall street journal 11 / 05 / 2001 the wall street journal cl ( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones & company , inc . ) as enron corp . ' s independent auditor , arthur andersen llp has the job of making sure the houston energy trader ' s financial statements not only are accurate and complete in all material respects , but also are understandable . now for the really tricky part : understandable to whom ? for andersen , this isn ' t just an academic question . once again , the accounting practices of one of the big five firm ' s most prized clients have come under intense scrutiny from regulators and shareholders . questions could well turn to whether andersen fulfilled its obligation to protect investors ' interests . and an important focus is likely to be whether andersen should have required enron to better explain its dealings with partnerships run by former chief financial officer andrew s . fastow before agreeing to bless the company ' s financial statements . enron revealed last month , in a conference call , that its shareholder equity had fallen by $ 1 . 2 billion during the third quarter as a result of transactions in which a partnership controlled by mr . fastow was at least at times involved , fueling a steep dive in the stock price amid growing concerns about the company ' s financial health . many wall street analysts , including die - hard enron bulls , long have grumbled that parts of enron ' s financial statements are indecipherable . " the heart of disclosure is intelligibility , " says alan bromberg , a professor of securities law at southern methodist university in dallas . " if the people to whom it ' s addressed can ' t understand it , it hasn ' t been adequately disclosed . there ' s clearly a qualitative , as well as a factual , component to disclosure . " under generally accepted accounting principles , the rules for disclosing related - party transactions seem straightforward enough . among other things , companies must describe the " information deemed necessary to an understanding of the effects of the transactions on the financial statements . " but the nation ' s accounting - standard setters never have offered any clear guidance on whether companies ' disclosures should be understandable to a broad audience or merely to financially sophisticated individuals with specialized training . and even sophisticated investors are prone to being stumped now and then . to be sure , the adequacy of a company ' s related - party disclosures can be determined only when all the information about the transactions is out in the open . for its part , enron - - which is hardly the only large energy company with complex partnership dealings - - maintains its off - balance - sheet transactions were legal and properly disclosed . " they comply with reporting requirements , " says enron spokeswoman karen denne , adding that andersen was aware of the transactions and reviewed them . " to the extent that an investor doesn ' t understand them , they are able to ask questions . " and in the end , she notes , investors who didn ' t understand the transactions didn ' t have to buy enron stock . enron ' s disclosure practices stand out , however , because they have been a source of complaints for so long . even some top - flight accounting professors say they can ' t make heads or tails of the company ' s transactions with mr . fastow or enron ' s motives for entering them . if they can ' t figure them out , it raises the question of whether any outsider could . one thing is certain : the stakes for andersen could be high . since enron ' s disclosure of the reduction in shareholder equity , its stock has plunged 67 % to $ 11 . 30 as of 4 p . m . in new york stock exchange composite trading friday - - a drop that wipes $ 20 billion off the company ' s market value and potentially exposing enron and andersen to massive shareholder liability . already , enron ' s dealings with the partnerships are the subject of a formal investigation by the securities and exchange commission . that creates the possibility that andersen itself could become a focus of the probe at some point , should regulators find enron ' s accounting and disclosure practices deficient . meanwhile , the law firm for a special committee set up by enron ' s board has hired accounting firm deloitte & touche llp to help review the partnerships ' activities . an andersen spokesman , david tabolt , says the firm " will continue to cooperate with [ enron ' s ] special committee , lawyers and accounting advisers " and " will also cooperate with other official investigations as requested . " so far , he says , the sec hasn ' t told andersen it is a subject of the enron probe . beyond that , he declines to comment on enron , citing client - confidentiality obligations . how murky are the related - party disclosures in enron ' s audited financial statements ? here is a summary of a section in enron ' s 2000 year - end financial statements describing certain transactions with the fastow - operated partnerships . the company said it transferred assets valued at $ 1 . 2 billion , including $ 150 million in notes payable , 3 . 7 million restricted enron shares and the right to receive as many as 18 million enron common shares in march 2003 , subject to certain conditions . it also transferred to the partnerships other assets valued at $ 309 million , including a $ 50 million note payable and " an investment in an entity that indirectly holds warrants convertible into common stock of an enron equity method investee . " in return , enron said it received " economic interests in the entities , " $ 309 million in notes receivable and an additional $ 1 . 2 billion in notes receivable as part of a " special distribution . " the disclosure went on to mention a series of purchases by enron of " share - settled options from the entities " on shares of enron common stock . the raw numbers may all be there . but " any objective person would be hard pressed to understand the effects of these disclosures on the financial statements , " says douglas carmichael , an accounting professor at baruch college in new york . " the quality of the disclosure is low , which creates uncertainty about the quality of their accounting . " further , he says , enron ' s explanation of why it entered the transactions " seems to defy imagination . " in the year - end financial statement , enron said the purpose was " to hedge certain merchant investments and other assets , " a category that includes energy assets whose values are prone to wide price fluctuations . yet the disclosure shows that enron chose to use shares and options of its own stock as its chief hedging instrument , even though their price movements wouldn ' t appear to be directly related to the value of the investments enron was trying to hedge . " i don ' t see how that possibly hedges any of enron ' s risks or assets , " mr . carmichael says . indeed , the disclosures have given rise to widespread speculation that enron ' s actual purpose was to use its off - balance - sheet transactions to shift losses off its books to avoid running them through its income statement . asked whether that was enron ' s purpose , ms . denne declines to comment . she says enron stands by its earlier statement that enron was trying to hedge certain investments . to date , andersen hasn ' t been named as a defendant in any of the numerous shareholder lawsuits filed against enron , which paid andersen $ 52 million last year , including $ 25 million in audit fees . enron ' s woes come during a year already filled with embarrassments for andersen . in june , the sec fined andersen and three partners $ 7 million over their audits of waste management inc .

Subject: re : status clayton , we can discuss your request when i come back to the office on monday . regarding the trip to portland . such a trip requires an explicit prior permission from your boss , myself in his absence , or stinson in my and vasant ' s absence . in case you did not ask for such a permission before , the request is denied . vince clayton vernon @ enron 07 / 20 / 2000 03 : 12 pm to : vasant shanbhogue / hou / ect @ ect cc : vince j kaminski / hou / ect @ ect subject : status vasant - i hope you had a wonderful vacation back home , and are rested and recovered from the long flight back . i wanted to give you an update of the eol project , the gas model , and of my intentions here at enron . software ( in compiled c on the unix platform ) has been developed and debugged to listen to the eol trades , process them , book them , and file them away . in addition , software has been developed and debugged to mark these to market on a continual basis , and to store the entirety of open positions on eol in a dynamic matrix facilitating analysis . it has yet to get back with me on how the software can be informed of those trades ultimately rejected for credit purposes . these data files are stored in a format for reading by excel or by sas , for which i have written the data step program and basic tabulation routines elucidating the structure of the data . i am in the process of documenting all of this for you . with regards the gas model and its slow performance on the compaq , dell has agreed to loan me one of their competing machines to the compaq , to see if the performance issue of the lp is related to the compaq . i have been researching this issue with it here and with compaq and dell . the new machine will be here any day now ( no financial obligation to anyone ) , and i will be able to immediately ascertain whether the problem the model is having is compaq - specific . i am also in the process of documenting the gas model for you . i ' ve tried to do my best for you , vasant , but i have been frustrated by not only the death of my mother but some internal systems in it here . just the other day , sas could not open a full query of the eol database because there wasn ' t enough free space on the server ' s hard drive for the workfiles . in discussing some of these issues with some good friends of mine in power trading , people whom i have known for over 10 years , they indicated they were ubiquitous here . the power traders have similar pc ' s to my new one , and they have complained from day 1 that theirs are slower than their old ones . also , there remains a large frustration with the development of data warehouses ; during my brief tenure here it has gone through two differing proposals as to how to address this . when i have been told of tools available for real - time data harvesting , my requests for such have typically been met with " well , we have it , but we haven ' t really tested it yet . " an example is the weather : we still do not record to disk the hourly nws observations from the goes satellite . my interests here are to help enron to do well , because i will do well only if enron does well . these aren ' t empty words - my ira is 100 % invested in the enron stock fund . i believe my best contributions to enron will be in the areas of systems as well as modeling , and the difficulty working in the research group , in terms of systems development , is that , frankly , few people at enron seem to care what a researcher thinks about our systems . we aren ' t directly generating revenues for enron , and we aren ' t really their customers , except in our relatively small deparrtmental infrastructure expenses . as it happens , power trading posted an opening for a modeling and forecasting person , and i spoke with them and they asked me to take the job , reporting to george hopley . it is a wonderful opportunity for me , vasant , as they are interested in large system modelng of power grids as well as improving their traders ' access to real - time fundamentals data . i was completely candid with kevin presto regarding my shortcomings here in research - i told him you were disgusted with me because i repeatedly failed to meet time deadlines . they also understand i have yet to be at enron for 1 year , and thus may only bid on a job with your permission . we agree the move is good for enron ; we all work for enron , and your acquiescence to the move does not endorse it but merely permit it . they are comfortable with me - they have known me for years as a hard worker , honest and unpretensive . they have already ordered a state - of - the - art unix workstation and server for me , and they have told me they will commit whatever resources are necessary for me to be successful , including hiring an analyst to work for me . and , i have already been able to teach their analysts improved techniques for data harvesting and analysis i have learned here . so , i am requesting your permission to bid for this job opening . it would be a lateral move in position and salary , and i would commit to you to help you in any way possible in the future with regards the gas model or the eol database . i will continue to work on their improvement , and complete their documentation . as it happens , i am away on enron business in portland monday and tuesday , and will be back wednesday . i had wanted to talk face - to - face instead of by email , but enron business supercedes - i am on a team designing the data warehouse for floor trader support . clayton .

Subject: re : estimating tail of distribution and additional risk measures naveen , the " analytical var " approach is working for equity portfolio . it gives us the tool to examine the tails ' behavior for this portfolio and calculate " expected tail loss " . the same should be done for commodities portfolio as well . meanwhile , as we discussed , we can give some rough estimates of the losses corresponding to percentiles other than 5 th . look at the figure below . you can see var numbers for 5 % , 1 % , 0 . 5 % and 0 . 1 % calculated with 1 ) simulations ( 100 thousand simulations ) ; 2 ) analytical var ( gamma - delta positions representation ) 1 ) and 2 ) are very close because there are not many options in equity portfolio . 3 ) simulations ( 1000 simulations ) to calculate 5 % var . then in order to approximately estimate var for 1 % , 0 . 5 % and 0 . 1 % i scaled 5 % var with factors corresponding to normal distribution ( for example : norminv ( 0 . 001 , 0 , 1 ) / norminv ( 0 . 05 , 0 , 1 ) for 0 . 1 % ) . the result of such extrapolation in this case is quite good ( just 5 % different from the correct number ) . we probably can use such rough estimates of tail for commodities portfolio until we have proper methods implemented . tanya tamarchenko 02 / 28 / 2001 01 : 17 pm to : wenyao jia / hou / ect , debbie r brackett / hou / ect @ ect cc : vince j kaminski / hou / ect @ ect subject : re : " analytical " var implementation in risktrac debbie , i am forwarding to you a 2 page document describing implementation of " analytical " var in risktrac . here is why this effort is very important : 1 . we need to calculate var for other percentile but 5 ( 1 % or even 0 . 2 % as mentioned by rick buy ) and our simulation model can not handle required number of simulations ; 2 . we need to present additional risk measures ( such as mean tail loss ) to the board . the analytical approach is implemented in a spreadsheet and fully tested already so there will be no problems with the algorithm itself . we need to get together and discuss it implementation . what do you think ? tanya

Subject: western update 5 / 7 / 01 executive summary ? the likely outcome of the 16 may elections is a victory by the bc liberal party ( currently holding polls at 70 % ) , a pro - business , right - of - center party led by gordon campbell . ? major changes in british columbia energy policy are likely under a liberal government . ? a low snow pack , a return to regulation by the bc utilities commission and public concern about outstanding debts owed by us power consumers could force bc hydro to stop out - of - province power sales once existing contracts expire ? bc hydro ' s additional generation at williston is likely undeliverable liberal party platform ? income tax cut that would make bc ' s income tax the lowest in canada ? independent audit of the province ' s books amid allegations of ndp mismanagement and incompetence ? review of all crown corporations ( including bc hydro ) to enhance efficiency and management quality ? campbell has also said that he wants to scrap the corporate capital tax , the machinery equipment tax and the corporate income tax . energy agenda according to sources , under the liberal party ' s rule , significant changes in the bc government ' s energy policy could include a move toward the privatization of some bc hydro assets , perhaps including its transmission assets , as well as increased government support for independent power producers and coal - fired production . at the same time , a rate review and attempts to establish a broad electricity strategy for the province could lead to a lack of clarity about the province ' s overall energy strategy over the next few years . campbell reportedly is a proponent of deregulation and of expanding coal - fired production . campbell calls thermal coal , " an asset that we want to be able to move forward with and to encourage once again in bc . " a high - ranking ndp source believes that campbell will take the province back along the path of natural resources extraction rather than promoting new technology . the source expects this to lead to strong protests from environmentalists . " these are confrontational moves , and people will be on the streets . " campbell ' s most likely choice for energy minister is richard neufeldt , though we caution that this decision depends on the make - up of the legislature after the election . neufeldt is responsible for the liberal party ' s energy , mining and northern development portfolio . sources speculate that if right - wing liberals are dissatisfied with the party ' s performance after the may election , neufeldt could again defect to the opposition . however , this gives campbell even greater incentive to name neufeldt energy minister , a high - profile position . should the liberals win the election , gordon campbell has indicated that he would return bc hydro to regulation by the bc utilities commission . the bc government has derived $ 5 . 5 billion in revenue from bc hydro since 1991 ( roughly 85 percent of its profit ) . critics say this has undermined the utility ' s ability to pay down approximately $ 7 . 5 billion in debt and invest in the future . this also has left hydro without a rate stabilization fund , something that sources feel may be needed this year . campbell reportedly intends to address these issues , and one can expect this to lead to calls for change . electricity export policy currently the bc utilities commission is demanding more information about bc hydro ' s out - of - province sales . the commission has warned that , given the low snow pack , the utility could be a net importer of power this year . supporting this view , the northwest power planning council , representing bc hydro ' s key trading partners in the us , has said that it would not be able to rely upon british columbia or alberta during peak consumption periods over the next few years , and that its customers face a 25 percent chance of not making it through the winter without power losses . the combination of a low snow pack , a return to regulation by the bc utilities commission and public concern about outstanding debts owed to bc hydro by us consumers may force bc hydro to stop out - of - province power sales once existing contracts expire . bc hydro privatization a key campaign energy issue for the liberal party is the privatization of bc hydro . campbell has urged greater electricity competition , saying , " we need to ensure the transmission infrastructure is available to all , producers and consumers , on an equal and non - discriminatory basis . " he stated that independent power producers have been discouraged at every turn . " i want to change that big time , " he told the canadian institute of energy . campbell also urged more natural gas development , including pipelines and co - generation plants . campbell backtracked on this stance last week after being challenged by ndp leader ujjal dosanjh . campbell stated on 25 april , " we have no intention of selling bc hydro ; we have no intentions of selling their transmission lines , no intention of selling their dams , we have no intention of selling their reservoirs . " liberal party spokesman mike morton also reiterated on 29 april that bc hydro would not be for sale . a high - level ndp source commented that campbell has been extremely careful in his choice of words regarding bc hydro , essentially saying that he would not privatize the dams , transmission lines or generating stations , but that he is in favor of opening the sector up to competition . however , local sources believe that some parts of bc hydro might be sold as part of an overall review of bc crown corporations to enhance efficiency . likely sale prospects include bc hydro ' s distribution channels and its energy trading subsidiary , powerex . in addition , gary farrell - collins , the liberal finance spokesperson and possible second choice for energy minister ( after neufeldt ) , has stated that public ownership of bc hydro ' s non - core businesses , such as westech , its systems division , and customer billing , could come under review . bc hydro williston generation current reservoirs levels at bc hydro ' s williston hydro - generation facility are at 2 , 150 ft , which allows bc hydro to drop levels another 35 ft ( 170 gwhs / ft ) under their current permit . the one drawback to this plan ' s additional generation involves the mackenzie pulp mill that would have to cease operation if water levels were to fall below 2 , 140 ft . sources close to the minister of mines & energy - elect , richard neufeldt , indicate that levels at williston probably will not be drawn down below mackenzie ' s operational limits due to concern over political backlash .

Subject: re : louise : my responses : 1 . the carrying costs have been capitalized , and under the accounting rules will continue to be capitalized through the last payment date under the turbine contract . 2 . at this time , the turbine value is undetermined . while we have identified one potential counterparty ( montana power ) , we do not have a signed deal . in addition , we are in the middle of a contract dispute with westinghouse regarding the damaged generator . while we hope to resolve this dispute in the context of our exiting the turbine position , there exists the potential of this going into litigation . 3 . janet and i proposed the deal i discussed with you to calme in december , but never got a formal response . i have put in several calls to elio tortolero at calme , but have not heard from him for about a month . he advised me at that time that he would get me a counter proposal . my group has had de facto management responsibility for the unit since december . 4 . this unit was initially an ena unit , but was taken by calme ( david haug ) i believe in december ' 99 for projects they were considering . i am not aware of the terms of that transfer . fyi , i have attached a payment schedule for the turbine . please let me know if you have any other questions . also , i have attached an updated site bank map which includes our texas site which was inadvertently left off the previous e - mail . regards , ben louise kitchen 03 / 28 / 2001 08 : 56 am to : ben jacoby / hou / ect @ ect cc : subject : this was the response from jim - if you have all the answers already - please give me a ring - otherwise can you pull the answers together and then give me a ring . thanks louise louise : i need to know two things : ( 1 ) have the carrying costs been expensed through jan . 1 and ( 2 ) is there commercial value to the turbine ? if there is value to the turbine , then i really don ' t understand allocating costs to a business unit that doesn ' t own the turbine in order to create the illusion of a profitable transaction . i also need to know on what basis and against what agreement calme agreed to bear the carrying costs . the project it supposedly related to has been dead for several years . jim

( 2 ) a change in the ecommerce landscape combined with auctioning technology becoming a commodity makes it very difficult to sell the application and associated intellectual property . enw has approached 22 separate companies about a purchase of the software since april with no outright bids . ( 3 ) however , the auction and deal room functionality was used by many internal business units for a variety of reasons . according to expected budgets and expected costs prior to events vs . actual results after auctions and deal rooms occurred , enron business units realized approximately $ 8 million in value . in the past , ena has done 13 data rooms , ees did 2 live auctions , ebs did 3 live auctions , corp . did 4 live auctions , tax did a deal room and nbpl did 2 auctions in addition to the small amount of business that was done by non - enron clients . therefore , the question going forward is if several business units in enron will take the application on an allocated or commitment to services basis for 2002 . the total estimated expense for the application ( depreciation , ongoing technical and commercial support , etc . ) is $ 2 million for 2002 . if a representative of each business unit would get back to me with an answer soon , that would be great . the application works well and has provided real value to enron . if there is not enough interest in it , i will discuss with whalley what we do about potentially shutting it down . thanks . greg piper chief executive officer enron net works , llc _ _ _ _ _

Subject: re : sitara release ( re : changes in global due to consent to assignment ) changing counterparty names on sitara deal tickets has absolutely no impact to any downstream processes . i hope the following will give more clarification . let me know if you have any questions or need more detail ! thanks , dg 3 - 9517 sitara / unify - process * scenario - counterparty name changes on sitara deal ticket after deal had been pathed , scheduled & bridged back from unify . * impact - zero impact to logistics & volume management , absolutely harmless . settlements has process in place to eliminate issues . * process - counterparty a in sitara changes to counterparty b . ctprty a was on original path sent to pipeline . the new name ( ctprty b ) does bridge over to unify . ctprty a remains at the path level in unify ( gui display does not change ) ctprty b is now displayed at the deal level in unify . the field is now highlighted to indicate a change occurred . ( gui display changes only at high level , not on path ) the scheduler has choice to repath ( if necessary ) , or not re - path if re - pathing occurs , the new counterparty name will be displaced on new path unify pushes back the deal number & meter to sitara ( not ctprty info ) balancing works on deal number & meter only ( not ctprty info ) the confirmation desk utilizes the information in sitara ( where all information is correct ) volume management utilizes the information in unify for pipeline tie - out . ( all information sent to pipeline is correct at the path level and will match up perfectly ) settlements utilizes information in unify . settlements recognizes that changed ctprty names changes contracts , which would create two notification entries if invoice did happen to go out to wrong ctprty , re - draft would occur . ( note : there was an issues discovered on reports which it is correcting now ) autonoms " tom ' s words of warning " - previously there was an issue when counterparty name changes took place after deals were pathed and nominated . basically it would change a key on an edi path ( duns number ) not affecting any other of the information already nominated to the pipeline . if the scheduler re - nominated , data at the pipeline would get doubled up and the scheduler would have no way to correct the problem . in most cases , the schedulers would have to get the pipeline to manually cut the original nominated volume . this is not an issue with unify ( as explained above ) .

( edi imbalance qtys would not match up to paths ) this may also cause an issue with the scheduled quantities ( especially where nominations were sent for entire month ) can ' t remember the rules on this one , but i think unify does have some safe guards ( idiot proofs ) to force re - pathing . unify does have the ability to over - ride duns numbers , yet would still cause an additional step for edi the scheduler would need to think through in order to get a clean quick response . what are ( if any ) impacts to vol mgt if counterparty name changes take place ? ( prior periods ? re - pathing ? ) i have a call into diane and dave both . after speaking w / them , hopefully i can get a clear understanding of the true impact . i am sure we ' ll need to put some processes and procedures together for deal validation to follow when these type of changes are needed . will keep you posted . thanks , dg from : thomas engel 04 / 05 / 2000 09 : 44 am to : kathryn cordes / hou / ect @ ect , dana daigle / corp / enron @ enron , elizabeth l hernandez / hou / ect @ ect , julie meyers / hou / ect @ ect , b scott palmer / hou / ect @ ect , stephanie sever / hou / ect @ ect , dianne j swiber / hou / ect @ ect , peggy hedstrom / cal / ect @ ect , dianne seib / cal / ect @ ect cc : sylvia a campos / hou / ect @ ect , linda s bryan / hou / ect @ ect , faye ellis / hou / ect @ ect , donna consemiu / hou / ect @ ect , scott mills / hou / ect @ ect , russ severson / hou / ect @ ect , martha stevens / hou / ect @ ect , karie hastings / hou / ect @ ect , regina perkins / hou / ect @ ect , imelda frayre / hou / ect @ ect , william e kasemervisz / hou / ect @ ect , hunaid engineer / hou / ect @ ect , steven gullion / hou / ect @ ect , larrissa sharma / hou / ect @ ect , donna greif / hou / ect @ ect subject : sitara release ( re : changes in global due to consent to assignment ) regarding the ability to change counterparties on deals in sitara with confirmed volumes - tom ' s words of caution : if someone calls you and wants to change a counterparty - we created the ability for you to invalidate the deal - and then change the counterparty - however - i did add a warning message : " warning - changing counterparty on deal with confirmed volumes - make sure pipeline allows this change . " some pipelines do not allow us to change counterparties after there is feedback - i assume for the same reasons we had this rule - it used to blow up our old scheduling systems ( pre - unify ) . some pipelines will require a new deal and we will have to zero out the old deal . before you make the change - make sure the logistics person is aware - just in case it causes problems with their pipeline . sorry - i don ' t know which pipes these are - you will have to ask the unify team . there is one rule still in place - you can change from ena - im east to ena - im market east - but not from ena - im texas to hplc - im hplc - when changing business units - they must be the same legal entity . " warning - not the same legal entity " also - beware of making contract and counterparty changes to service deals ( transport capacity , storage , cash out ) . once the deal is invalidated - there are no rules . don ' t forget - the items were locked down for a reason . if you invalidate a service deal - and change the previously locked down data that was validated - and someone used these deals in unify - it is highly likely that the unify deals and paths created using these deals will get corrupted . always check with someone from unify to make sure no one used these deals for anything in unify . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - forwarded by thomas engel / hou / ect on 04 / 05 / 2000 09 : 47 am - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - from : scott mills on 04 / 04 / 2000 07 : 38 pm to : kathryn cordes / hou / ect @ ect , dana daigle / corp / enron @ enron , elizabeth l hernandez / hou / ect @ ect , julie meyers / hou / ect @ ect , b scott palmer / hou / ect @ ect , stephanie sever / hou / ect @ ect , dianne j swiber / hou / ect @ ect cc : steve jackson / hou / ect @ ect , thomas engel / hou / ect @ ect , sylvia a campos / hou / ect @ ect , linda s bryan / hou / ect @ ect , faye ellis / hou / ect @ ect , donna consemiu / hou / ect @ ect subject : sitara release ( re : changes in global due to consent to assignment ) with the release that was put out tuesday evening , deal validation should be able to change the counterparty on deals where the volume is something other than expected ( e . g . confirmed , nominated , scheduled , etc . ) . in addition , this release will also capture " near - time " the contract changes that are made in global . this means that need for server bounces will not be necessary . new / changes to contracts will show up without having to get out of deal manager . new counterparties , and new / changes to facilities will require getting out of all active sitara apps ( except for launch pad ) . once out of all apps , start a new app - the respective information that you are looking for will appear . i mention " near - time " because we are constrained by the amount of time it takes for the change in global data to trigger an alert for sitara who then updates its information srm ( x 33548 ) cyndie balfour - flanagan @ enron 04 / 04 / 2000 03 : 41 pm to : connie sutton / hou / ect @ ect , linda s bryan / hou / ect @ ect , kathryn cordes / hou / ect @ ect , scott mills / hou / ect @ ect , richard elwood / hou / ect @ ect , dave nommensen / hou / ect @ ect , kenneth m harmon / hou / ect @ ect , dana daigle / corp / enron @ enron , kathryn cordes / hou / ect @ ect , elizabeth l hernandez / hou / ect @ ect , julie meyers / hou / ect @ ect , b scott palmer / hou / ect @ ect , stephanie sever / hou / ect @ ect , dianne j swiber / hou / ect @ ect , gayle horn / corp / enron @ enron , brant reves / hou / ect @ ect , russell diamond / hou / ect @ ect , debbie r brackett / hou / ect @ ect , steve jackson / hou / ect @ ect cc : subject : changes in global due to consent to assignment the following changes will be made in the global contracts database due to receipt of executed consent to assignment for the following contracts : current counterparty name contract type contract # ' new ' counterparty name ces - commonwealth energy services gisb 96029892 commonwealth energy services ces - samuel gary jr . & associates , inc gisb 96029302 samuel gary jr . & associates ces - south jersey gas company gisb 96029143 south jersey gas company cp name change and contract type correction ( contract type different than that provided by ces ) per ces ces - southwest gas corporation 1 / 1 / 98 gisb 96029146 per contract file ces - southwest gas corporation 04 / 14 / 93 master purchase / sale interruptible ( will edit global # 96029146 ) & ces - southwest gas corporation 12 / 01 / 94 master sale firm ( created new global record to accommodate this k , # 96037402 ) please note that southwest gas corporation has consented to the assignment of both of these contracts .
Subject: fw : a positive note about enron . move over carly fiorina . . . : - ) - - - - - original message - - - - - from : jaffry , adil sent : thursday , october 04 , 2001 9 : 32 am to : jafry , rahil subject : fw : a positive note about enron . fyi . . . from cbs . marketwatch . com , online at : attacks highlight enron ' s value by lisa sanders 3 : 02 am et oct 4 , 2001 houston ( cbs . mw ) - - in the wake of the sept . 11 terrorist attacks , one of the few places to buy or sell jet fuel was an online market maintained by enron . the attacks highlighted the houston company ' s strength as a manager of risk during periods of heightened uncertainty . through its trading centers , the company gives customers a way to hedge against volatility in oil , natural gas , and electricity markets , as well as other commodities . although the company lost one employee aboard one of the hijacked planes and closed its operations on the day of the attacks , its trading activity resumed the next day . by coming back online so fast , " we made the decision to provide some stability in the market , " said vance meyer , an enron spokesman . " the customers really appreciated the fact that we were there , providing a place for them to maintain and adjust their positions in the market . " in a financial sense , enron ( ene ) didn ' t suffer , meyer said . but employees at the enron building in downtown houston were badly shaken . nick humber , who worked for enron ' s wind energy business , died aboard a los angeles bound flight that crashed into the world trade center . " we have offices in washington and new york , and people who had friends that died or were affected in some way , " meyer said " we also had traders who were on the phone with people in the world trade center when the planes hit . " the decision to temporarily halt commodity trading on the new york mercantile exchange in the wake of the attacks " may have increased volatility , a boon to the group , " said bob christensen , analyst at fac / equities . companies that can defray volatility by helping customers manage their energy costs should be seeing a lot of business , he said . managing risk is what enron does best , market players say . and that strength should help the company going forward as u . s . businesses try to recover from the impact of september 11 . through its enrononline platform , the company buys and sells commodities at volumes totaling about $ 3 billion a day , meyer said . " the world at large has become more risk averse , and enron , which is in the business of risk mitigation , should benefit from that , " said glen hilton , senior analyst and portfolio manager for the montgomery new power fund , which has a stake in enron . " with energy risk and prices potentially going up , they ' ll be the first number on many cfos ' speed dial . " other companies do what enron does , but it ' s the best positioned to succeed because of its status as the leader in natural gas and power trading , measured in terms of volume . duke energy ( duk ) is the next - largest competitor , but it has one - third of enron ' s volume . high profile departure that ' s a good place to be for a company whose stock price has been on the skids since last year , though it grew 151 percent on the top line in 2000 . other problems notwithstanding , including its money - losing broadband business and its failure to sell the oregon utility portland general electric , enron ' s largest black eye came in mid - august when jeffrey skilling , chief executive since february , resigned abruptly . john hammerschmidt , senior portfolio manager of the turner new energy and power technology fund , said he " freaked out " when skilling left and managers immediately divested the turner large - cap portfolios of enron holdings . despite its status as a growth player , turner had re - entered the stock in june after a long absence because of valuation . at the time , enron was trading in the mid to high $ 40 s . " this is a premier company and a premier industry , " he said , adding that he believed then that the market had priced rumors into the stock . one of the rumors was that enron was about to take a big loss from being long on power when power prices were collapsing , hammerschmidt said . that has not materialized . whatever the problems were , hammerschmidt said , he felt them to be manageable . when skilling walked out , hammerschmidt began to believe some of the rumors might be true . " in our experience , when somebody in power leaves for no reason , there ' s uncertainty and uncertainty makes growth guys real nervous , " he said . management continuity now he ' s looking to get back in . enron , he said , works in both down and up markets . " enron ' s earnings are more solid today than they ' ve ever been . . . and they ' re valuable because we ' re becoming a digital economy , " he said . " we need high - quality power , and local power plants have trouble providing reliability . enron is focused on guaranteeing people quality power in times of stress on the system . " of course there ' s still the issue about trusting management . after skilling left , enron promoted greg whalley to president and chief operating officer and mark frevert to vice chairman . " you cannot expect ( whalley and frevert ) to articulate the enron vision the way jeffrey did , " christensen said . " they may grow into it . " on the upside , skilling predecessor ken lay , who wall street credits with building enron into a powerhouse , is back at the helm , and he has promised to remain at the post until a solid succession plan is in place . " we have a great deal of confidence in mr . ken lay as he was the original architect of ene ' s ( and for that matter the entire industry ' s ) tremendous transformation for the past decade , " merrill lynch stated in a research report the day after skilling left enron . what ' s more : " ken lay has promised more transparency at enron , more insight into how the company makes money , which will help , " hilton said . " trying to forecast enron ' s earnings is difficult . " christensen said that a " lack of data and clarity in regard " to enron ' s wholesale operations has been an issue in the past . enron has promised to provide more information when it reports its third - quarter results on october 16 . ultimately , only time will assuage investors ' concerns . but with the prospects that enron has , the stock is a deal right now , hammerschmidt said . " i don ' t know what gets people back , but buy enron at $ 25 , and in a year , you ' re making money , " he said . " i can see the stock getting back to $ 50 in a blink . "

Subject: re : letter to nesbitt vince , your note looks good to me , short and to the point . i assume this will prompt further detailed discussions with dale . i would want to clarify that we are primarily interested in the long term gas model and database for north america . unless a familiarity with the short term model is a prerequisite , i doubt that we would want to spend a lot of time on it . depending upon how long it would take to become familiar with the long term model , it might be helpful to have access in both omaha and houston ? we would eventually need specifications for the computer system we would need for testing the model . steve hotte , cio for ets , would co - ordinate the in - house installation for us . at some point , it will be helpful to get steve in contact with the appropriate marketpoint it rep . assuming that you get acceptable clarification of these issues , dale should probably send to us a modified licensing agreement for review . let me know what i should do next . jng

Subject: strange bedfellows senators dianne feinstein and gordon smith announce partnership in response to the western energy crisis march 15 , 2001 washington , dc - senators dianne feinstein ( d - ca ) and gordon smith ( r - or ) today announced an agreement to introduce bipartisan legislation to restore stability and reliability to the western energy market by directing the federal energy regulatory commission ( ferc ) to impose a temporary " just and reasonable " wholesale rate cap or cost - of - service based rates . the legislation will also require the states involved in this effort to pass on the cost of the electricity to retail customers . however , the states would be able to determine how and when this would be done . in other words , california could choose to use tiered - pricing , real - time pricing or set a baseline rate above which prices would be passed through . " we now have a piece of legislation that can fix the broken electricity market and provide a period of reliability and stability in wholesale energy costs , " senator feinstein said . " ferc has found the wholesale prices being charged in california to be unjust and unreasonable . this legislation essentially will mandate that once ferc makes such a finding , the agency will carry out its regulatory role . this is a $ 175 million a year agency . it is there to regulate the energy marketplace , and it should . what the federal government can do is to provide a period of reliability and stability at a time of crisis . unfortunately ferc has refused to do so . " " california ' s broken electricity market is a result of a flawed 1996 california law that deregulated wholesale costs , but left in place caps on retail prices . this was coupled with a requirement that the utilities divest themselves of their generating capacity and buy most of their electricity on the spot market , where prices have escalated dramatically . in hindsight all of this came together in a catastrophic scenario , so that today , california buys electricity at astronomical prices . we believe that ferc needs to act to help restore reasonable costs and stability to this marketplace .

' s planned acquisition of enron . mr . lay ' s decision capped a day in which he appears to have changed his mind on the matter at least twice . early in the day , an enron filing with the securities and exchange commission laid out mr . lay ' s severance package . by midday , enron indicated that mr . lay would keep only one - third of the payout , which he would take in stock in the combined company , and that he intended to donate one - third to a foundation to help displaced enron employees . the remaining third would cover income - tax liabilities . but by the end of the day , enron spokesman mark palmer said that mr . lay , following a meeting of enron energy traders , had decided against taking any of the severance pay . though mr . lay didn ' t attend the traders ' meeting , senior managers told him that " opinions were expressed that he shouldn ' t receive the payment , " mr . palmer said . " he decided the cleanest thing to do was to waive the payment . " the opinions of traders carry particular weight because they produce most of enron ' s profits . questions for mr . lay were directed to mr . palmer , who said he had spoken with mr . lay and other company officials during the day . the initial disclosure about mr . lay ' s hefty severance payment raised new questions about his willingness to sell enron for a share price that was about a third of the market price of a month ago . last friday , mr . lay even said that enron had other options to the dynegy purchase , which might have allowed the energy company to remain independent , though he declined to elaborate . " things weren ' t desperate . . . we had alternatives , " mr . lay said . the 59 - year - old mr . lay won ' t have an executive position at the combined company , though he might be a director . for the 12 months ended aug . 31 , mr . lay received about $ 70 million through the exercise of enron options , according to disclosure reports compiled by thomson financial . last year , mr . lay was paid $ 8 . 3 million in salary and bonus and more than $ 10 million in stock awards and other compensation . enron , the nation ' s largest energy trader , saw its stock collapse in recent weeks following a series of disclosures about the company ' s extensive dealings with partnerships run by some of its own officers . those dealings are under investigation by the sec . last friday , enron agreed to be acquired by the far smaller houston - based dynegy for stock , currently valued at about $ 10 . 7 billion . the merger agreement still must be approved by regulators and shareholders of the two companies . separately , the california public employees ' retirement system , which owns about three million enron and 500 , 000 dynegy shares , said it would oppose the appointment of any current enron board member to the board of a combined company . michael flaherman , chair of calpers investment committee said that it appeared that enron ' s board " failed in its responsibility " to monitor the activities of enron executives . mr . palmer , the enron spokesman , said mr . lay had provisions in his employment contract to protect him against a sudden change in control from 1989 forward . in february 2000 , when enron stock was trading between $ 60 and $ 70 a share and mr . lay was being widely lauded for his performance , he negotiated a bigger severance package than he had previously . last august , when chief executive jeffrey skilling quit unexpectedly , mr . lay assumed mr . skilling ' s duties and his contract term was extended by two years to dec . 31 , 2005 . under the terms of his contract , mr . lay is entitled to payment of $ 20 . 2 million for every full calendar year left on his employment contract , in the event that his employment terminates within 60 days of a change in control . thus , mr . lay is entitled to three full years of payments , or $ 60 . 6 million . mr . lay , who took charge of the then - houston natural gas co . in 1984 when it was a regional pipeline company , wasn ' t the only member of his family to benefit from enron ' s heady rise to a global energy giant . sec filings show that in recent years a sister of mr . lay , sharon lay , and a son , mark lay , received millions of dollars in salary , commissions and bonuses related to ms . lay ' s travel agency and a paper - products company connected to the younger mr . lay . mr . palmer said it is a " cheap shot " to criticize the lay family because the pertinent transactions were reported in several annual proxy statements . " the contracts were bid out and fairly awarded , " mr . palmer said . ms . lay said her travel agency , of which she is president and half - owner , had won its enron business through competitive bidding and by providing " the very best service possible . " mark lay couldn ' t be reached for comment . coming on top of disclosures of enron ' s dealings with partnerships run by its own executives , the relationships between lay family members and the company again raise questions about enron ' s willingness to keep separate corporate and personal interests . former chief financial officer andrew fastow and possibly other enron executives made millions of dollars from these partnerships . mark lay ' s dealings with enron date back to 1994 , according to the available sec filings . in may 1997 , mark lay and " certain other individuals " who together had been officers , directors or shareholders of a company called paper & print management corp . , or ppmc , entered into employment agreements with an enron unit , enron capital & trade resources , according to enron ' s 1998 proxy statement . the individuals helped set up " a clearinghouse for the purchase and sale of finished paper products , " according to the sec filing . mr . palmer said this effort formed the rudiments of enron ' s profitable paper and pulp - trading business . as part of the deal , enron agreed to reimburse ppmc $ 1 million for certain expenses . mark lay and his colleagues also agreed to " convey " to enron " certain intangible property rights " from ppmc . mark lay also got a three - year employment contract from enron as a vice president of enron capital & trade . he got a signing bonus of $ 100 , 000 , a minimum monthly salary of $ 12 , 500 , a minimum annual bonus of $ 100 , 000 for 1997 - 1999 and an option to purchase 20 , 000 enron shares . mark lay is no longer with enron and is now attending a seminary , said mr . palmer . since 1985 , sharon lay ' s firm , lay / wittenberg travel agency in the park inc . , has provided travel arrangements for employees of enron and its predecessor company . for this work the agency received $ 6 . 8 million from 1996 through 2000 . in an interview yesterday , ms . lay said enron accounted for more than half of her firm ' s revenue in some years . she said her brother ' s position was " more a problem " than an asset since it led some to assume she hadn ' t worked hard enough to get enron ' s business . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . inside track enron ceo cut stakes in firms where he sits in director ' s seat by cassell bryan - low staff reporter of the wall street journal 11 / 14 / 2001 the wall street journal cl 4 ( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones & company , inc . ) kenneth l . lay , enron corp . ' s embattled chairman and chief executive , in recent weeks has cashed in nearly $ 2 million of shares in companies at which he sits on the board . mr . lay , 59 years , sold $ 1 . 2 million of shares , or more than a quarter of his holdings , of compaq computer corp . , where he has been a director for 14 years . in his first sale of the houston - based company ' s shares since 1999 , he disposed of 124 , 596 shares oct . 29 for $ 9 . 25 each , leaving him with a 340 , 724 share stake . apart from two directors who resigned , he is the only compaq insider to have sold shares this year . the sale comes as the computer company awaits completion of its planned merger with hewlett - packard co . - - a deal the board has repeatedly said it supports . in a nov . 7 news release , the board , including mr . lay , said it " reaffirmed its strong support for the proposed merger . " a day earlier , h - p ' s founding hewlett family , which controls 5 % of h - p stock , said it intended to oppose the merger , throwing the deal ' s future into uncertainty . compaq shares traded at $ 8 . 80 , up $ 1 . 14 , as of 4 p . m . in new york stock exchange composite trading yesterday . the sale , mr . lay said , wasn ' t related to his views on the merger . " it ' s no negative [ reflection ] on compaq , " he said . mr . lay , who also sold shares of drug maker eli lilly and it has disclosed a regulatory probe into its complex transactions with off - balance - sheet partnerships . shares have recovered some ground since friday ' s announcement by dynegy inc . , a rival houston independent power producer , of plans to acquire enron . shares of enron traded at $ 9 . 98 , up 74 cents , or 8 % , on the big board as of 4 p . m . as previously reported , mr . lay sold $ 25 . 7 million of his enron shares this year , as the stock fell from about $ 78 to under $ 44 , and his remaining stake is valued at about $ 28 million . for 2000 , he earned a salary of $ 1 . 3 million , a bonus of $ 7 million , plus $ 7 . 5 million in enron restricted stock and other benefits , including use of a personal plane , according to enron ' s proxy statement . mr . lay , who was enron ' s ceo from 1985 until february of this year , resumed the post after his successor , jeffrey skilling , stepped down in august after only six months on the job . at that time , mr . lay agreed to stay on through 2005 , but his employment agreement provides for a lump - sum payment under a change of control , such as the proposed merger with dynegy , according to a regulatory document filed yesterday . the deal is expected to close sometime next year , in which case mr . lay would be entitled to $ 60 . 6 million under his contract if he terminates his employment within 60 days of the merger . in addition , mr . lay is entitled to an amount for any related tax penalties if the payment was deemed to constitute an " excess parachute payment , " the filing said . mr . lay also serves on the board of eott energy corp . - - the general partner of eott energy partners lp - - and newpower holdings co . mr . lay also recently sold his stake in i 2 technologies inc . , according to his spokesman , following mr . lay ' s resignation from the board of that company oct . 25 after serving for a year . as of march 2001 , he owned 13 , 000 shares of the dallas business - software company , a stake that would have been valued at about $ 64 , 000 at the time he resigned . - - - robin sidel contributed to this article . copyright ? 2000 dow jones section c the markets : market place enron chief will give up severance by richard a . oppel jr . and floyd norris 11 / 14 / 2001 the new york times page 1 , column 5 c . 2001 new york times company trying to quell a furious reaction from employees outraged that he stood to profit from a merger with dynegy inc . , kenneth l . lay , the chairman and chief executive of the enron corporation , decided late yesterday to give up a severance package worth more than $ 60 million . the tumult at enron ' s headquarters in houston began after the company disclosed in a securities filing earlier in the day that mr . lay was in line to collect $ 60 . 6 million in pay after the deal closed next year , $ 20 . 2 million for every full calendar year left in his employment contract . mr . lay had been a popular leader as enron grew in the last 15 years from a pipeline operator into the nation ' s largest energy trader , a business largely of his invention . employees shared in the gains , though none gained as much as mr . lay , who has collected more than $ 300 million since 1989 , mostly through exercising stock options . but the value of employees ' stock options and their 401 ( k ) accounts evaporated this fall as enron shares plummeted amid concerns over the company ' s accounting practices . and traders and other workers started the day yesterday gossiping angrily about mr . lay ' s severance package . then , at an afternoon meeting of employees in the company ' s core natural gas and electricity trading operation , which provides by far the biggest part of enron ' s profits , ' ' quite a bit of concern was raised about the news people had been seeing about this change - of - control payment , ' ' mark palmer , an enron spokesman , said . at about 4 p . m . central time , two senior executives who had attended the meeting , john lavorato and louise kitchen , told mr . lay about the reaction of employees . ' ' ken made a decision shortly thereafter that the best thing to do would be to waive the payment altogether , ' ' mr . palmer said . even if dynegy ' s directors later voted to award mr . lay a new severance agreement , he would turn it down , mr . palmer added . ' ' what ken said is that this is the absolute cleanest way to remove any doubts , that he was not going to profit as a result of this change of control , ' ' mr . palmer said . ' ' this issue was causing enough concern among employees that he wanted to deal with it . ' ' severance pay had been an awkward matter for mr . lay in the last week . the only reason that enron was being acquired - - putting the severance clauses in his employment contract into effect - - were the financial problems that have occurred on his watch . the company ' s shares have lost almost 90 percent of their value after peaking in the summer of 2000 . during merger discussions last week , mr . lay told dynegy ' s chairman , charles l . watson , that he wanted to rework the severance package , mr . palmer said . on monday , mr . watson disclosed that mr . lay wanted much of the severance to be in the form of stock options . by yesterday afternoon , enron officials were saying that mr . lay planned to take two - thirds of the severance in stock or other noncash compensation . and , they said , he wanted to give half of that amount , or one - third of his total package , to establish a charitable foundation to benefit enron employees . it was about an hour later that enron said mr . lay would give up the severance entirely . mr . lay has not decided whether to accept an invitation to be on the board of the combined company , which will be called dynegy . the deal could still fall victim to antitrust objections or disclosures of further financial problems at enron . whether mr . lay ' s gesture will placate enron ' s traders , who are now deluging other energy - trading companies with resumes , remains to be seen . dynegy is known as a much more conservative firm than enron , and analysts renewed their concerns yesterday about the cultural clash draining the talent , and value , from the combined company . ' ' so much of their top talent is going out the door , i don ' t know what dynegy gets , ' ' said a senior executive at another rival firm . the stunning near - collapse of enron - - bankruptcy was only averted , some analysts say , by the dynegy acquisition - - closes a chapter on one of the most influential careers in the history of the energy business . the ugly circumstances of enron ' s downfall , including the revelation that partnerships were used to move debt off the company ' s balance sheet and that enron overstated profits in the last five years by almost $ 600 million , have left mr . lay ' s reputation in tatters . just months ago , mr . lay was widely hailed - - or decried , in some circles - - as the genius behind energy deregulation . his friend , george w . bush , had been elected president , and policies favored by enron were front and center in the administration ' s energy policy . mr . lay retired from day - to - day management , making plans to pursue new business interests . but he again assumed the chief executive ' s post at enron in august , after the unexpected resignation of his handpicked successor , jeffrey k . skilling , and the accounting problems swiftly unfolded in the weeks that followed . on monday , mr . lay said he might revive the business plans he set aside during the summer , but he declined to say what those plans were . even without the severance package , mr . lay has become enormously wealthy running enron . all told , from 1989 through this year , mr . lay collected about $ 13 million in salary ( his exact salary for this year is not known ) and $ 26 . 8 million in cash bonuses . but those sums were dwarfed by the $ 266 . 7 million in profits that he received in selling stock . the bulk of his income from exercising options came in the last four years : $ 13 . 1 million in 1998 , $ 43 . 9 million in 1999 , $ 123 . 4 million in 2000 and $ 20 . 7 million this year - - a year in which he sold stock by prearrangement on every trading day through july 31 , and then stopped , not wanting to appear to be selling as the stock price was declining . the options he has cashed in recent years , as well as those he now owns , are badly out of the money at enron ' s current stock price of $ 9 . 98 , down from a peak reached in 2000 of $ 90 . 75 . his bonus in 2000 was $ 7 million , an award that enron ' s board said was based on the company ' s rising profits and high shareholder return . the company restated those profits last week , explaining that it had improperly applied accounting rules . it said that about 40 percent of its profit in 2000 came from transactions with partnerships that were controlled by andrew s . fastow , who was then enron ' s chief financial officer . the company ' s stock price , which was in free fall after questions about the fastow partnerships prompted an investigation by the securities and exchange commission , fell to $ 7 a share in the wake of the disclosures . that was the lowest price for the stock since 1991 . it rebounded to nearly $ 10 after dynegy agreed to acquire the company in a stock swap . in january , enron ' s board awarded another bonus to mr . lay , of $ 3 . 6 million . that was based entirely on the company ' s shareholder return from 1997 through 2000 , which came to 294 percent , the company said . all of that return has since been wiped out . also in january , mr . lay was awarded 106 , 578 shares of restricted stock , to vest periodically through 2004 . all the shares will now vest when the dynegy deal is completed , and while their value has plunged , the award is still worth more than $ 1 million . still , mr . lay suffered huge paper losses this year . at the end of 2000 , he had 5 . 1 million options that could have been exercised for profits of $ 257 . 5 million , and another 1 . 5 million options that would have been worth another $ 104 . 1 million when enough time had passed that they could be exercised - - assuming the share price stayed level . he exercised 565 , 928 of those options this year , making a profit of $ 20 . 7 million , but the ones he did not exercise are now under water . photo : kenneth l . lay , the chief executive of enron , decided to give up his severance of more than $ 60 million after complaints from employees .

" we don ' t have any track record here , " said ernest gellhorn , an antitrust expert at george mason university . the deal will be reviewed by state and federal agencies , but the most critical approvals will come from the federal energy regulatory commission ( ferc ) and us antitrust agencies . central to the antitrust review will be how competition authorities define the market - how big it is , which companies are included as competitors , and how the market share is divided up . former antitrust officials said enron might be forced to resort to a " failing firm " defence , which is occasionally used by companies with large market shares when attempting to add to their dominant position . but robert mctamaney , an antitrust partner at carter ledyard & milburn , said the failing - firm route may be difficult for dynegy and enron to prove , since it requires a showing that without the merger , enron ' s trading business would exit the market completely . helping the companies , however , is the relative ease with which competitors can enter the trading market , experts said . an analysis of barriers will hinge on whether rivals can successfully argue that the level of expertise in the industry is so sophisticated - or that enron ' s trading technologies are so specialised - that it would be impossible for new entrants to duplicate the company ' s operations . dynegy executives said they expect more scrutiny from ferc , though it rarely rejects mergers , and its guidelines put an emphasis on speed of reviews .

" ken lay will not accept the dollars 60 m when he leaves , " an enron spokeswoman said . " he felt like it was not the right thing to do . " according to a filing with the securities and exchange commission , mr lay is entitled to dollars 20 . 2 m in cash for every remaining year in his employment contract if he leaves enron within 60 days of the company being taken over . mr lay ' s decision is in sharp contrast to other senior us executives who have negotiated - and accepted - " golden parachutes " which guarantee them large payments even if they oversaw large - scale destruction in shareholder value . mr lay had previously come under fire from shareholders for selling some of his enron shareholding before the collapse in the company ' s stock price . between january and july this year , he sold enron shares with an estimated value of more than dollars 27 . 5 m . at the close of trading yesterday enron was valued at dollars 7 . 5 bn , compared with a peak of dollars 65 . 9 bn in august last year . the terms were part of mr lay ' s original employment contract , which had been due to expire in december 2003 . but in august , following the sudden departure of chief executive jeff skilling , enron ' s board extended mr lay ' s contract by two years . at the time , the contract extension was seen as an attempt by mr lay to restore investor confidence in the company . but it also ensured he would receive an additional dollars 40 . 4 m if he left following a sale . after the dollars 10 . 8 bn dynegy takeover , mr lay is expected to give up his executive responsibilities . he may join the combined group ' s board of directors but this will not affect his eligibility for a pay - off . the deal , which requires the approval of us competition authorities , is expected to be completed next year . copyright : the financial times limited 1995 - 1998 business ; financial desk enron chief relinquishes severance pay jerry hirsch times staff writer 11 / 14 / 2001 los angeles times home edition c - 1 copyright 2001 / the times mirror company enron corp . chief executive kenneth l . lay on tuesday waived a severance payment of at least $ 60 million due him when dynegy inc . completes its expected acquisition of enron next year , company officials said . the potential payment , disclosed in a securities and exchange commission regulatory filing tuesday , would undoubtedly have sparked additional controversy , given lay ' s primary role in the sharp fall of enron ' s stock and worsening financial condition , which led to the dynegy deal . the payment would have been one of the biggest rewards for failure in corporate history , said graef crystal , a leading compensation expert . the payment would have topped the nearly $ 40 million mattel inc . paid former chief executive jill barad after she was ousted in 2000 after spending $ 3 . 6 billion to purchase a money - losing software business the company eventually gave away to a technology group in return for a slice of future profit . it would have been almost double the $ 35 million in severance collected by former xerox corp . chief executive richard thoman when he was fired in may 2000 after a disastrous reorganization of the copier company ' s sales force . according to enron spokeswoman karen denne , lay spoke to a number of employees tuesday and " decided that the best course of action would be for him to waive his right to payment . " " instead , " denne said , " the combined company would decide the best use of those funds . " lay and enron have run into a storm of criticism in recent weeks after the disclosure of a series of partnerships and the dismissal of several top executives who invested in those ventures . news of the partnerships and their losses forced the houston - based company to restate its earnings last week , reducing corporate profits over the last four years by $ 586 million , or about 20 % , to $ 2 . 3 billion . shareholders have filed a series of lawsuits against enron , charging the company with failing to disclose key information about its operations and financial structure . the negative disclosures sparked a cash crunch and threatened enron with collapse until it was saved by an agreement friday to be acquired by houston - based dynegy for $ 9 billion . shareholders have watched the value of enron shares decline almost 90 % from a high of nearly $ 90 on aug . 23 , 2000 . its shares closed tuesday at $ 9 . 98 , up 74 cents , on the new york stock exchange . ceo already reaped $ 150 million in options according to the regulatory filing , lay stood to collect $ 20 . 2 million a year , plus certain extraordinary tax expenses , for each of the full years remaining on his contract once the company was acquired . if the dynegy deal is completed as expected next year , lay ' s payment would have totaled at least $ 60 . 6 million . his contract ends on dec . 31 , 2005 . lay already reaped about $ 150 million in stock option gains the last two years alone . those gains were in part made possible by rosy enron profit statements , which the company restated downward last week , crystal said . " it is a good move to waive the payment , " crystal said . " but that ' s just the down payment on what he should give back . there is probably another $ 100 million in option profits he should give back . had they correctly stated the books , the stock would not have risen as high and he would not have made as much from exercising his stock options in the company . " a stock option gives the holder the right to purchase a share of a company at a predetermined price . options are a common executive pay incentive , allowing the individual to purchase and sell the shares , pocketing the gains in their appreciation . lay made $ 123 million off such transactions last year and $ 26 million this year , crystal said . lay since 1989 has had a " change of control " clause that awards him a special payment if enron changes hands . the company described the clause as a standard part of executive employment agreements common to many companies . some wall street analysts said the liability for the payment would be dynegy ' s problem at the point the merger is completed . enron shareholders already have suffered all the damage they are going to see . " enron has clearly lost the vast majority of its shareholders over the last six months with its piecemeal disclosure , destruction of shareholder value and loss of credibility , " said andre meade of commerzbank securities in new york . john sousa , a spokesman for dynegy , said the company was aware of the severance clause and had factored the expense into its acquisition , which " we believe is a very strong financial transaction " regardless of the potential payment to lay . photo : enron ceo kenneth lay has run into a storm of criticism recently . ; ; photographer : associated press copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . financial enron ceo says no to $ 60 . 6 million peter behr washington post staff writer 11 / 14 / 2001 the washington post final eol copyright 2001 , the washington post co . all rights reserved kenneth lay , chairman and chief executive of enron corp . , decided yesterday to forgo an expected $ 60 . 6 million severance payment because of the impact of enron ' s plunging stock price on the company ' s employees , a spokesman said . until yesterday , lay was preparing to accept the severance payout , which would be triggered at the completion of enron ' s purchase by rival houston energy company dynegy inc . , a deal announced on friday . enron faced a cash crisis after disclosing it has overstated its earnings by $ 586 million over the past four years because of improper accounting treatment of its investments in outside partnerships that were managed by its chief financial officer . the severance package was reported yesterday by bloomberg news , which included a blistering comment by andrew whalley , manager of a trust that sold $ 5 million in enron stock in april because of concerns with enron ' s financial reports , bloomberg said . whalley called the settlement " a ridiculous amount of money " to pay the chairman of a company that suffered " a textbook financial collapse , where he obviously had some knowledge of what was going on . " enron spokesman karen denne said around midafternoon yesterday that lay intended to donate one - third of the severance to enron employees , keep one - third and use the remainder to pay taxes on the entire package . lay , who built enron into the world ' s largest energy trading company , was entitled to a payment of $ 20 . 2 million multiplied by each year remaining on his employment contract if it was terminated before it expires at the end of 2005 . the purchase by dynegy is expected to close in 2002 , assuming regulatory approvals are forthcoming , giving lay three years of payments . lay said last week that he will retire once the deal is done . denne checked again with lay later in the afternoon and was told that he had decided not to accept any of the severance payment after a meeting yesterday with enron employees . " he realized this was extremely sensitive given the financial condition of enron employees , " denne said . many enron employees hold the company ' s stock in savings and retirement plans , and the stock price has fallen from a high of $ 90 a share in august 2000 to a low of $ 8 . 41 last thursday . enron ' s price has picked up since the purchase announcement , closing at $ 9 . 98 yesterday . dynegy has agreed to pay $ 23 billion for enron , about $ 10 billion of that in stock ( about $ 10 a share , when the deal was announced ) , while assuming enron debt for the rest . lay ' s compensation was increased nearly threefold , to $ 18 . 3 million , last year , when the company ' s annual revenue reached $ 100 billion and its stock hit an all - time high . lay realized a gain of $ 123 . 4 million from exercising stock options last year . he is entitled to purchase 782 , 830 shares of enron stock over the next seven years through stock options , according to a company filing , but those grants currently are worthless because of the collapse of enron ' s stock price . http : / / www . washingtonpost . com copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . enron ' s lay sells shareholdings in other companies , wsj reports 2001 - 11 - 14 05 : 53 ( new york ) houston , nov . 14 ( bloomberg ) - - enron corp . chairman and chief executive officer kenneth lay has been selling shares of companies of which he is a board member , the wall street journal said . lay sold about $ 1 . 2 million , or more than 25 percent of his interest , in compaq computer corp . , where he has been a director for 14 years , the paper reported . he also sold 16 percent of his stake , or about 10 , 000 shares , in drugmaker eli lilly mikhail gorbachev , former president of the soviet union ; and colin powell , u . s . secretary of state . however , greenspan declined the cash and crystal sculpture that accompany the prize . it ' s logical that greenspan talked about energy , considering the award is named for an energy trading company , the institute is researching energy supply and security issues , and the home of the institute is the world ' s energy capital . " as we , as economic policymakers , understandably focus on the impact of the tragedy of sept . 11 and the further weakening of the economy that followed those events , it is essential that we do not lose sight of the policies needed to ensure long - term economic growth , " greenspan said . " one of the most important objectives of those policies should be an assured availability of energy . that imperative has , if anything , been elevated by the heightened tensions in the middle east - - an area that harbors two - thirds of the world ' s proven oil reserves . " greenspan reviewed the nation ' s experiences with seesawing energy prices and episodes of imbalances in supply and demand . he also discussed technologies to augment energy supplies , including coal mining , nuclear power and fusion power . " energy issues present policymakers and citizens with difficult decisions and trade - offs to make outside the market process ; as always , national security and environmental concerns need to be addressed in setting policy , " greenspan said . at the end of the speech , greenspan answered pre - selected written queries from the audience of students , faculty and invited guests . one questioner asked if the state of economy caused greenspan to second - guess his monetary policies . greenspan rephrased the question as to whether or not he had made a mistake . after much rhetoric , he in effect said no .

" after having discussions with employees today he decided that this is the right thing to do and he ' s going to leave it up to the combined company to determine the best use of that money , " denne told reuters . lay ' s contract , which runs through 2005 , calls for him to get $ 20 . 2 million for each full year left in his contract if enron is taken over by another company . enron and dynegy officials have said they expect to complete their merger by the third quarter of next year . denne said the clause , which is known in corporate circles as a " golden parachute , " has been in his contract since 1989 and is a " standard provision " for chief executives . denne said lay told enron employees of his decision in a company - wide e - mail . enron has been under the gun from wall street since mid - october when it said shareholder equity had been cut $ 1 . 2 billion because of off - the - balance sheet deals with partnerships run by former chief financial officer andrew fastow . the u . s . securities and exchange commission launched an investigation into the transactions , which sent enron ' s stock and credit ratings into a tailspin and drained its cash as trading partners refused to extend credit . on friday , enron and dynegy said they had agreed to merge at what seemed a firesale price for enron , which last year had $ 100 billion in revenues and $ 1 billion in earnings . also , on tuesday night , lay presented the enron prize for distinguished public service to federal reserve chairman alan greenspan in an event at rice university in houston . previous winners have included the likes of nelson mandela and mikhail gorbachev . prior to accepting the award , greenspan told students that the most important thing for anyone in the business world was to be ethical .

its probably not worked out because of what enron considers a fair discount on what it has sunk into the project . prospective buyers consider this too high an asking price . for the record , enron claims to have sunk in $ 1 . 2 billion in the project together with its partners ge and bechtel who have supplied equipment and helped construct the plant . but my gentleman friend in pin - stripes suggests that $ 1 . 2 billion isnt exactly their equity contribution in dabhol . that amount works out to just about $ 800 million . enron , actually splurged close to $ 200 million on development expenses , which in gentlemens lingo is another way of saying that the energy giant could have ended up bribing its way to see the once coveted project through besides fighting sundry court cases in india . and it wants part of that money back . now which prospective buyer will compensate enron for possible bribes or for making court appearances ? enron , it appears , has also claimed another $ 140 million as its share of dabhols retained earnings , which should eventually go to all stake - holders in dpc ( the mseb included ) once the companys board passes a resolution that the amount is shared proportionately among all those who have invested in dabhols equity capital . till then , leave the retained earnings aside . so , what enron should work on is a fair discount on its equity contribution in the project , which is no more than $ 800 million . now given its willingness to take a 30 per cent knock , enron should not expect more than $ 560 million as the asking price for walking out of dabhol . add to that , if you will , another $ 140 million by way of retained earnings and enron should not be getting more than $ 700 million at the most . is enron willing to take this knock ? given a choice , it could resist this offer . but enron has no choice . and thats reason for cheer . last week , enron , close to the present american dispensation ( chairman ken lay was the biggest fund - raiser for president george bushs campaign effort last year ) opted for a $ 7 . 8 billion rescue offer from smaller houston rival dynegy after narrowly escaping credit ratings cut to junk status . for the past several months enron had been using its clout with mr bush to push through a bail - out package on dabhol that suited its terms . that privilege now seems to be gone as the company grapples to stave off a securities exchange commission inquiry into off - balancesheet transactions . and until enron clears several questions back home about its finances , it will remain suspect in the eyes of us investors . in india , where enrons made more news for its misses than its hits , the timing couldnt have been more opportune than now for prospective private bidders to strike a potentially lucrative deal . two such bidders , tata power and bses , are said to have offered no more than $ 400 million to buy out enrons stake in dpc . its time they stuck to that price . or else , we could still end up being suckers . what ?

" ken put two pipelines together to make that company . i had six people and a smile , " watson told me during the chicago stop of an east coast - to - texas barnstorming to sell the deal to investors . enron was always the bigger glamor play . lay ' s move from a base of trading natural gas and electric power into the engineering of exotic financial deals in areas as diverse as communications bandwidth , paper , steel and media won a huge wall street following and doubled enron ' s stock price last year , to above $ 80 a share . dynegy by contrast seemed downright dull . though it dabbled in broadband communications , dynegy stuck mainly to the business of generating , trading and delivering gas and electricity . though dynegy ' s stock price nearly quadrupled last year to $ 59 , dynegy never turned heads the way enron did . today , enron has no friends left . the messy breakdown of enron ' s trades with outside partnerships has forced it into dynegy ' s embrace . watson thinks wall street went hard on enron because of the company ' s high - handed manner when it was on top . " if you have that personality and things go wrong , i mean , everybody ' s going to take your legs off , " watson says . this would be a tidy tortoise - and - hare tale except for one thing : enron ' s problems are such a mess , they could make for rough going at dynegy , too . watson thinks he has protected himself . he can walk from the deal if enron ' s legal entanglements exceed $ 3 . 5 billion . if , on the other hand , enron ' s problems don ' t get worse and other bidders emerge , he gets a healthy $ 350 million break - up fee and ownership of a key enron pipeline . that ' s better than nothing . but it ' s hardly a failsafe . some enron trades with the outside partnerships don ' t unwind for years , so problems might not emerge until after dynegy has closed its deal . there are more mainstream challenges , too . roughly half of enron ' s operating profits last year came from off - balance sheet transactions watson wants to eliminate . replacing that won ' t be easy . and watson needs to handle at least $ 14 billion in enron debt . enron ' s high rollers might not fit into dynegy ' s careful culture . watson ' s team also must stretch to run a company that , even with divestitures , will jump to at least three times dynegy ' s current size . watson ' s personality can be aw - shucks disarming . born at great lakes naval air station in illinois , the son of a navy officer , he lived in 22 places before he graduated high school . now , if he closes the deal , he ' ll be running one of the country ' s largest companies . no one would get a kick from taking watson down a notch . but that hardly means investors won ' t knock him if he can ' t make the enron deal work . copyright ? 2000 dow jones ceo says enron errors not illegal melita marie garza , tribune staff reporter 11 / 14 / 2001 chicago tribune north sports final ; n 1 ( copyright 2001 by the chicago tribune ) the downfall of energy - trading titan enron corp . was the result of " bad business practices " rather than illegal activity , says chuck watson , chief executive of dynegy inc . , the company acquiring enron in a deal valued at $ 24 billion . " i ' m not persuaded that you ' ll find anything illegal , " watson said tuesday , commenting on the securities and exchange commission ' s probe into enron ' s off - balance sheet transactions in energy partnerships . watson ' s comments came as enron , in a filing with the sec , disclosed that kenneth lay , the company ' s chairman and chief executive , could walk away with a golden parachute worth more than $ 80 million if the merger succeeds . under terms of a pre - existing employment contract , lay would receive $ 20 . 2 million a year for each full year outstanding on his contract if control of enron changes hands during his employment . at the same time , enron issued a letter to employees warning that the deal with dynegy was likely to result in workforce reductions at enron . " as with any merger , " the letter said , " some elimination of positions is almost inevitable . " enron , the nation ' s largest trader of natural gas and electricity , has seen its stock price collapse in recent weeks largely because of soured transactions with energy partnerships run by one of its former executives and additional revelations about questionable accounting practices at enron . power - trading rival dynegy , owner of downstate utility illinois power , moved last week to acquire its hobbled competitor , agreeing to pay the equivalent of about $ 10 a share for a company that as recently as last january traded above $ 80 a share . in a wide - ranging interview , watson criticized the practice at dynegy of permitting enron executives to sit on the partnership boards and profit from them . " you don ' t let that happen , " watson said . " it would never have gotten by me . " watson sees the distinction between illegal conduct and bad judgment at enron as significant because the absence of illegality would minimize grounds for shareholder lawsuits . dynegy has said the merger is contingent on litigation costs over enron ' s problems staying under $ 3 . 5 billion . " i don ' t think it ' s going to be anywhere near that level , " watson said . enron ' s misfortunes , watson said , paved the way for dynegy ' s opportunity . " this is all about brand , " he said . " they lost credibility and investor confidence . " dynegy ' s takeover of its higher - profile rival is a coup for dynegy , which has been viewed by some as an " enron wannabe . " but watson brushed off the description . " that ' s actually not true , " watson said . " it ' s clearly not true now . " watson asserted that nothing had gone wrong with enron ' s core businesses . that fact , he said , had been lost - - by investors and potential enron suitors - - in the controversy surrounding the off - balance sheet transactions . " maybe the tires fell off the car and the paint was chipped , but the engine was still strong , " watson said , referring to enron ' s core businesses . in an apparent conundrum , dynegy ' s bid for enron at what is viewed as a bargain basement price has not brought any other companies to the bargaining table . enron ' s problems reportedly scared off some prospective bidders , such as warren buffett ' s berkshire hathaway . watson argued that dynegy was uniquely positioned to pursue the enron deal , in large part because the rivals had extensive business dealings together . " it took our guys days - - not months - - to do due diligence , " watson said . " we were right there in town . it was the time factor , the knowledge that we had of the industry and the business . " for example , watson said shell oil co . , another company thought to have an interest in acquiring enron , would not have had the background to move as quickly as dynegy had in putting together the merger . while saying that he had respect for the regulatory approval process , watson reiterated his belief that the merger posed no antitrust concerns . " we don ' t have a pipeline business , they do , " watson said . " they don ' t have a generation business , we do .

" there have been serious allegations of self - dealing on the part of enron ' s senior management , " michael flaherman , chair of calpers investment committee , said after a meeting of the pension ' s administrative board .

" mr . jackson , speaking at a hotel just down the street from the headquarters of troubled enron , said now was the time for minorities to make their presence known with the proposed dynegy purchase of enron , its larger rival . he said spinoff companies and other opportunities created by the proposed merger , as well as deregulation of the texas energy market , offer possibilities for those who possess knowledge of the changing industry . " the question is not ' can we produce ? ' the question is ' can they see our capacity to produce , ' " mr . jackson said .

" many of them are not inherently racist . " " i would call it racism 10 years ago , " mr . jackson replied . " today i would call it cultural blindness and part of our job is to take the patch off their eye . " gaurdie bannister , shell oil ' s vice president of business development , said there are a number of individuals in large companies who are willing to " break eggs " with minority - owned businesses but often run into roadblocks because those companies are unable to cushion a large risk that would be taken , for example , in an offshore project . " if you are not big and you don ' t have the capital to take that risk with me , i can ' t use you , " he said . mr . scott said a way for smaller minority - owned businesses to get around such obstacles and get the big contracts is to combine their strengths . " join forces , " he said . " set your egos aside and you are going to have a lot more success because then you take away some of the risk .

" enron restating its earnings is certainly going to help our case . it demonstrates that in their opinion their earnings were false when initially published , " said lawyer arthur stock of berger & montague pc in philadelphia , one of the law firms seeking class - action status . enron declined to comment . the lawsuits name the company , chairman and chief executive kenneth lay , former ceo jeffrey skilling and andrew fastow , a former chief financial officer , as defendants . in another blow to its damaged reputation among investors , the houston - based company last week admitted it erred in reporting past results . it reduced its earnings from 1997 to 2000 by $ 591 million , or 22 percent of the amount that had previously been released on its financial statements . earnings for the first two quarters of 2001 also were restated . enron has garnered investor ire since it unexpectedly reduced shareholder equity by $ 1 . 2 billion in mid - october , saying off - balance sheet transactions had contributed to that and to $ 1 billion in charges . the company ' s stock plunged as almost daily developments sullied investors . it lost almost 80 percent of value from the day the company reported its first quarterly loss in more than four years on oct . 16 , to the announcement last week that rival dynegy inc . would buy enron for about $ 9 billion in stock and the assumption of about $ 13 billion in debt . enron shares closed tuesday 75 cents higher at $ 9 . 99 on the new york stock exchange , far off its august 2000 high of $ 90 . 56 . increased time frame in the latest lawsuit to be filed against enron since it was rocked by a u . s . regulatory probe in october , the law firm of cauley geller bowman & coates said misrepresentations and omissions by the defendants violated their duty to release accurate and truthful information on the company ' s finances .

" the way to look at the dynegy transaction is it really in a sense maintains the investment - grade quality to enron ' s credit rating , " said todd shipman , analyst at s & p . " it ' s safe to say that absent a dynegy deal , enron was quite likely to end up non - investment - grade quality because of what had happened , " shipman said . enron , the nation ' s largest energy trader , has been struggling to overcome a plummeting stock price and falling credit ratings in the past month following disclosures of off - balance sheet deals now under investigation by the u . s . securities and exchange commission for possible conflict of interest . s & p lowered its long - term corporate credit rating on enron to bbb - minus from bbb , its lowest investment - grade rating . a cut below that , to junk , would make it tougher for enron to issue debt and run its day - to - day business . the rating agency also placed the ratings of dynegy on creditwatch negative after the energy provider said it had agreed to acquire enron for about $ 9 . 5 billion . terms of the dynegy transaction call for dynegy to swap 0 . 2685 shares of its own stock for each enron share , the companies said . that would value houston - based enron at $ 10 . 41 per share , including convertible stock , a premium of about 21 percent over friday ' s closing price of $ 8 . 63 . the takeover announcement halted a free - fall in enron ' s stock , which has lost about 75 percent of its market capitalization in the past month . on tuesday , , enron shares closed at $ 9 . 99 , up $ 0 . 75 cents , or 8 . 12 percent , on the new york stock exchange . enron ' s debt , which has been trading at levels associated with higher - risk junk bonds , moved higher on the news . the company ' s 7 . 875 percent notes due 2003 were traded at 92 cents on the dollar , up from the mid - 80 ' s range last week , traders said . industry experts said the most critical component of the deal was an immediate cash infusion by dynegy shareholder chevrontexaco into enron . chevrontexaco , which owns a 27 percent stake in dynegy , has agreed to infuse $ 1 . 5 billion immediately into enron to support it until the deal closes . it would inject another $ 1 billion into the merged company once the deal closes . " that was an important part of that whole deal , not just dynegy coming in and offering money to buy enron out , but also providing that up - front liquidity to protect the value of enron ' s trading business , which is really the crown jewel , so to speak , that dynegy is interested in , " said shipman . s & p said dynegy ' s corporate credit rating is likely to remain within the bbb category , as a result of its purchase of enron , " we saw an investment - grade company , within a range of bbb - plus to bbb . " said shipman . " if things go as planned , dynegy would keep its credit rating . " s & p said it will continue to monitor the planned acquisition by dynegy of enron and warned that a downgrade to junk status for enron would be likely if the transaction is not completed . " the main thing we ' ll be monitoring at this point is enron ' s liquidity and the value of its trading franchise , because that ' s really what dynegy is interested in , " said shipman . " if there were to be an effect on enron ' s trading business that would be significant enough to reduce dynegy ' s interest in enron , that would raise the possibility that the merger would not be completed , then the possibility of downgrade would be very strong for enron , " shipman said . moody ' s investors service , another major u . s . rating agency , could not immediately be reached for comment on any potential rating actions after news of enron ' s buyout by dynegy . moody ' s rates enron debt in line with s & p , at " baa 3 , " its lowest investment - grade rating . enron , with $ 100 billion in revenues and $ 1 billion in profits last year , is fifth on fortune 500 ' s list of largest u . s . companies . dynegy , 54 th on the fortune list , had $ 29 billion in revenues and $ 500 million in earnings . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . enron ' s board should step aside from new company , calpers says 2001 - 11 - 14 00 : 22 ( new york ) enron ' s board should step aside from new company , calpers says pasadena , california , nov . 13 ( bloomberg ) - - enron corp .

in addition to the normal salary , benefits and payroll taxes , you will also be charged an overhead administration fee for the program . you will be charged the following monthly amounts for each analyst in the detail class code that i have indicated below : detail class description amount 1 salaries and wages $ 4 , 000 552 benefits 774 557 payroll taxes 360 820 corporate services 1 , 266 total monthly cost $ 6 , 400 the $ 4000 amount represents an average of all analyst salaries and does not indicate what the analyst in your rc is paid . this amount will not change in february as the

rc report , you will see a line item labeled " a and a reclass " in each of the detail classes identified above . enron north america is invoiced by corp . for the costs of all analysts . financial

you have currently . if there are any errors , please let me know as soon as possible so that i can work with brian heinrich to have it corrected in february . please continue to check your rc report

( nyse : dyn ) beat expectations in the third quarter , reporting that its earnings rose to $ 286 million , or 85 cents per diluted share , from $ 177 million , or 55 cents per diluted share , for the same period in 2000 . this represented a 22 - percent increase from 3 q 2000 and boosted the company ' s 2001 earnings estimate . dynegy has a market capitalization of $ 14 . 5 billion . its stock is currently trading at about $ 43 down from a 52 - week high of $ 59 , although it is important to note that for year - end 2000 the company ' s stock was one of the top performers among standard dynegy , on the other hand , not only believes in the ownership of physical assets , but has set a goal that could ultimately establish the company as owning one of the largest generation arsenals in the industry . let ' s look at the companies separately . we ' ll discuss enron first since it is the older of the two . enron readily admits that its strategy is difficult to define , but a close approximation is that enron literally creates commodity markets so that it can deliver physical commodities to customers . the participation and success in commodity markets , according to enron , does not necessitate ownership of physical assets . in fact , the company has routinely sold physical assets that are not considered to be strategic to its wholesale business . rather , enron has concentrated on developing a new philosophy of risk management excellence , in which it will merely buy and sell the commodities it needs to participate in trading venues . as an example , enron bought portland general ( which owns 2 , 000 mw of generation and 41 , 600 kilometers of electric t & d lines ) in 1996 as a way to launch its penetration of the west coast power markets . when competition fizzled in that region , enron put portland general back on the sales block ( a sale of portland general to northwest natural is pending at this writing ) . likewise in europe , where it is one of the most prominent trading companies , enron has disposed of generation assets such as sutton bridge in england and , unlike other u . s . competitors , has refrained from buying additional generating units in opening countries such as germany and italy . according to its most recent 10 k report filed with the securities and exchange commission , enron owns or controls 2 , 015 mw of generating capacity ( including joint ownerships ) , which is drastically lower than the average among other companies operating in the power trading sector . dynegy ' s approach to the market is crystal clear and radically different from enron ' s . in the words of ceo chuck watson , " dynegy ' s long - term strategy is to focus on marketing and trading around physical assets , which supports earnings sustainability . " ever since going public in 1995 , dynegy has been on an acquisition binge , with each purchase significantly increasing its generation capability . dynegy presently owns or controls about 27 , 000 mw of generating capacity in the united states , 26 gas - processing plants and 14 , 000 miles of pipelines , which are located in geographically competitive areas . the company ' s goal is to own or control 70 , 000 mw , or 10 percent of the u . s . market , within the next five years . sometimes , dynegy has acquired assets through partnerships with other companies such as nrg energy , but just as often it has purchased assets independently . most notably , when dynegy acquired illinova in early 2000 , the purchase doubled dynegy ' s generating capacity . dynegy is now attempting to replicate this approach in europe , where it is presently planning to purchase natural - gas storage facilities in england . dynegy executives have argued that natural - gas storage is the best way to back up a natural - gas trading operation . there ' s no question that the approach is working . out of the $ 286 million that dynegy reported in the third quarter , $ 263 million of it came from the company ' s main wholesale business . the issue of asset ownership is probably the central defining difference between enron and dynegy , and its significance should not be overlooked . it is not difficult to make a case that supports dynegy ' s approach . owning physical assets often enables a trading company to gain information in the course of operating power plants that can help the company to gauge markets and anticipate small changes in price . in other words , by controlling the actual output of generation instead of just being involved in buys and sells , a trader such as dynegy will theoretically know what the load is going to be in a particular region , how much power can be produced to meet that load and when shortages might occur . in addition , in markets that are short on infrastructure , it may be difficult for a trader to participate in the market unless they actually have ownership of physical assets in the region . by the same token , those companies that do control physical assets often have greater communication with grid operators , and possible insight to spreads ( the difference between various energy prices ) . in fact , dynegy ' s ceo watson fully acknowledges that his company excels at being able to trade around the volatility of price , and being capable of resolving balances when shortages exist . this may be more difficult for a company such as enron to accomplish when it has no physical generation of its own to meet discrepancies in power bids . dynegy ' s strategy of acquiring both natural - gas pipelines and power plants also gives it the flexibility to trade on both commodities . on the other side of this argument , a case could be made that enron ' s approach provides more flexibility in reacting to trading volatility . certainly , by investing less in power generation facilities , enron has less capital on the line when compared to a company like dynegy . under a scenario when market prices suddenly drop , a company such as enron that does not have heavy capital invested in power generation could actually fare better than an asset - laden company because enron does not face the pressure to meet the fixed payments of a generation facility . asset - heavy companies also may find that their earnings could be impacted by the investment in generation facilities in times of extreme price volatility . as the industry becomes increasingly focused on bottom - line results , this could be seen as a potential concern for investors . further , some would argue that enron ' s approach of establishing purchasing contracts with various parties to meet its buy and sell requirements is the rough equivalent of owning a generation facility . what enron gains by this approach is the presumed flexibility it has by not being tied down to a specific generation unit and being able to build its own portfolio . consequently , the issue of asset ownership can perhaps be considered the " great debate " among power traders . however , although dynegy ' s overall performance in the third quarter was better than enron ' s , that does not necessarily provide a clear endorsement of dynegy ' s strategy toward acquiring new generation facilities . keep in mind that enron ' s 3 q losses resulted primarily from non - recurring charges related to its non - core businesses ( broadband and water in particular ) . without these charges , enron ' s core wholesale trading business continues to perform well . this is a point that ceo ken lay has been quick to reiterate to investors . " our 26 - percent increase in recurring earnings per diluted share shows the very strong results of our core wholesale and retail energy businesses and our natural - gas pipelines , " lay said . " the continued excellent prospects in these businesses and enron ' s leading market position make us very confident in our strong earnings outlook . " moreover , perhaps even more than ownership of physical assets , the key issue that played a role in the current disparity between dynegy and enron earnings in the third quarter is the companies ' approach to developing new lines of business . telecom is a perfect example to illustrate the point . enron , which prides itself as usually gaining a first - strike advantage , plunged into the telecom sector well ahead of other energy companies . under the leadership of then - ceo jeffrey skilling , enron sunk large sums of capital into purchasing broadband capacity on the expectation that the market would quickly become lucrative . now lay admits that the company " could have gotten into the broadband business with less capital " and that enron " spent too much too soon " in this sector . nevertheless , enron recorded an $ 80 - million non - recurring write - down for restructuring its broadband unit in the third quarter and is presently attempting to stop the bleeding in this sector by reducing future costs in this sector to $ 40 million a quarter . dynegy took a much more cautious approach toward expanding into the telecom sector and made a comparatively small amount of investment when compared to enron . dynegy has likewise been impacted by the slowdown of the telecom sector , but in the third quarter took a $ 15 - million loss in its broadband business compared to the $ 80 - million loss that enron reported . however , dynegy clearly specializes in marketing and trading two commodities ( electricity and natural gas ) and seems to add other businesses in a very methodical way that merely supplements its core business . it is also important to note that enron gained the first - strike advantage when it developed enrononline , an electronic trading exchange . in fact , enron was the first to create such an exchange in the energy space , well ahead of its competitors . dynegy later followed this trend with creating dynegydirect . the two exchanges are different in terms of their trading standards , but it is important to acknowledge that in this particular case enron was successful in launching into the electronic trading space well ahead of its competitors . the latest available information indicates that enrononline has recorded transactions that exceed $ 590 in notional value . since its inception in november 2000 , dynegydirect has recorded $ 33 billion in notional transactions . at this juncture , dynegy and enron are very different with regard to their approaches toward financial reporting . enron , which has often been accused of not providing a balance sheet to investors , is currently struggling from a serious image problem as the securities and exchange commission pursues an investigation of possible mishandling of funds by enron ' s cfo . to my recollection , no one has ever accused dynegy of not providing a balance sheet , and thus the company ' s status with investors is arguably more solid . as i don ' t expect either company to radically alter its competitive strategy any time soon , my projection is that ( at least in the near term ) , we will continue to see a wide disparity in wall street performance between dynegy and enron . that is not to say that anyone should count enron out of the game . as noted , the company ' s core business of wholesale business remains strong , but clearly has been tainted by the impact of other non - core businesses . that doesn ' t mean enron is down permanently , but it will have to find a way to strike a better balance between the businesses that it does best and those businesses that former ceo jeffrey skilling believed were advantageous . in many ways , the comparison between dynegy and enron is rather like the tortoise and the hare parable . i am sure you can guess which company is the tortoise and which is the hare in this analogy . the race between the two is far from over , although dynegy is taking the lead at this point , based on its more methodical approach . what will be fascinating to observe is how both companies continue to adapt to changes in the marketplace and possibly modify what up to this point have been adamantly espoused philosophies . _ _ _ _ _ correction statement to 10 / 23 issuealert on european trading : according to a news report from reuters , the u . s . -

" . from : fran l mayes / enron @ enronxgate on 05 / 30 / 2001 02 : 14 pm subject : stock option questions we have received questions from many employees concerning the expiration date for stock options . the q & a dated march 8 , 2001 stated three years as the exercise date for options . however , on page 1 of the document , a statement was included regarding the intent of the document and that the stock option plan document will govern all provisions of the stock option program . if you have options listed on the stock option termination report which list a one year expiration , not three years as stated in question # 16 of the document , this is correct and follows the provision of the plan document . some employees have options granted under a different stock option plan and that plan carries a three year term of expiration . please review your report carefully to determine which plan your options were issued under . additionally , the document was intended to provide general information only . page 1 included the statement regarding the plan document specifically in case there were any errors made in the document . additionally , we stated that employees could obtain copies of the plan document for their review . enron provides the plan documents so that employees can familiarize themselves with the plan and make decisions based on plan document . i apologize for any confusion this may have caused , however , the plan under which the options were granted is the official document by which enron determines the termination date . please call me if you need to discuss your options , however , understand that i cannot speak with you regarding other employees ' compensation / options .
Subject: response to proposal issues steve , below is a partial answer to most of your questions . can we set a time for wednesday afternoon 12 / 5 to talk ? thanks max hourly quantity : we are reviewing capability to deliver the mhq in a 16 hr block . doesn ' t appear to be any problem . what will be the plant ' s complete hourly capability ? contract rate : will be a negotiated rate ( eliminates rate risk for gila ) . the rate design is currently one - part ( no differentiation between reservation and commodity ) . the rate does not include aga / gri surcharges or fuel . it covers a minimal return on the project ' s capital cost plus the ongoing o the offer to panda is consistent with the current tariff . delivery term : as the term gets shorter , the rate by necessity , goes up to cover the return hurdles . services : delivery pressure at the panda / epng interconnect should be a minimum 750 # capacity of the lateral from copper eagle to epng will be 500 , 000 dth / d . alternative rec / del combinations : our thought here was if panda is willing to commit to taking capacity in the project , then tw would give you all the necessary flexibility to move gas to other destinations at the contract rate . for instance , panda would be paying a one - part rate for delivery to the plant . if for some reason , plant demand was reduced , then you would have all the flexibility to move gas to alternative markets . backhaul : the 50 , 000 / day would be a guarantee . daily imbalances , short notice start up / shut down : we have to plan for the worst case scenario and assume there is no storage . with this in mind , tw will have some flexibility just due to the size of the project ( 36 " pipe and 750 - 900 # pressure ) but this will depend on what other shippers are doing .

Subject: tw bullets 12 / 22 cal border backhaul - operational linepack , slightly reduced demand at the cal border , and california ldc ' s returning imbalance gas , all combined to create an excess gas inventory position at the border for tw . we then received a shipper request to backhaul some volume to southwest gas at las vegas . the inventory position necessitated that tw sell some of the gas for the backhaul and we negotiated a pg this resulted in delivery cuts to pnm who then canvassed the market to look for alternate supply . late tuesday morning pnm called asking about park n ride capability on tw . we negotiated a $ . 45 rate for 20 , 000 mmbtu for one day ( $ 9 , 000 ) . because the rate was above max , we had to file the deal with ferc . this was exacerbated by the fact that because of the customer ' s request for service , we had to ask ferc for a waiver on the " one day prior notice " requirement . ferc california pricing - ferc staff members continue to call for help in understanding transport and commodity prices for gas at the cal border . news to us was the fact that ferc has access to enrononline but did not understand how to use it . they are also getting a subscription to gas daily . capacity west - on thursday 12 / 21 we did a one day posting for an additional 10 , 000 mmbtu / d of lft capacity for january from san juan to cal border . the current january spread to needles is $ 5 . 40 net of fuel . southwest gas - we met with swg management last week to discuss the service being provided by tw at their new interconnect . so far everything is working well , however , swg is attempting to maximize their flexibility under the oba agreement and their ability to take swing gas from tw . our response has been we will continue to help them when we can within operational limits but we cannot jeopardize the rest of the tw west system . swg indicated they would like more information regarding our mainline expansion project ; they recently purchased 85 , 000 mmbtu / d of capacity on the kern river system . pogo producing - pogo would like to flow gas to tw ' s west texas lateral by february 1 . they estimate volume of 20 , 000 mmbtu / d and have no qualm on the approximately $ 400 , 000 interconnect cost . this is a new well near the recently connected eog well .

Subject: overview of investor conference call today , enron hosted a conference call to give investors a current overview of the company . here ' s an update of what we discussed during the call . we told investors that we ' re doing everything we can to protect their interests and to regain their confidence . our focus remains on our credit quality , balance sheet and liquidity , which are essential for our continued success and expansion of our wholesale businesses . it took more than a few weeks to get where we are today . here ' s a snapshot of significant events that led to our current situation : - - in hindsight , we definitely made some very bad investments in our non - core businesses over the past several years . those include investments in azurix , india and brazil . they have performed far worse that we could have ever imagined when we made these investments ; - - because of these bad investments , we ' ve become over - leveraged as a company . the negative impact of those investments was exacerbated through the extensive use of debt capital both on and off our balance sheet ; - - we also entered into related party transactions that led to a loss of investor confidence , which has been very damaging ; - - we ' ve been criticized for our lack of transparency and our hard - to - understand financial and operating disclosures ; and - - on top of it all , we discovered errors in our financial statements , as discussed in our 8 - k filing last week , that required a restatement of previously reported earnings . we ' ve taken a new look at our businesses and have separated them into three areas : core businesses , non - core businesses , and businesses under review . core businesses our core businesses remain strong and consistent sources of significant earnings and cash flows for the company . they ' re our competitive advantage . these include : - - natural gas pipeline businesses ; - - gas and power businesses in north america and europe ; - - retail businesses in north america and europe ; and - - coal businesses in north america and europe . the events of the past few weeks have had a temporary negative impact on our projected fourth quarter profitability . it ' s too early to tell at this time what impact this might have on our operating results . we are considering these actions now so that we can quickly return to normal business in 2002 . i also remain optimistic that the actions we ' ve taken over the past couple of weeks have addressed our customer and counterparty credit and liquidity concerns . according to our business unit leaders , we have definitely seen improvement in our counterparty relationships . non - core businesses our non - core businesses include our global assets group and our broadband division . we have invested more than $ 8 billion in these businesses , and the return from them has been dismal . we have an aggressive program in place to exit these businesses and expect that the sale of these businesses will generate billions of dollars in cash that we can use to repay debt and reinvest in our core businesses . we already have more than $ 800 million in assets contracted for sale this year . they include ceg rio , a gas ldc in brazil ; ecoelectrica , a power plant and lng receiving terminal in puerto rico ; and asset sales of offshore oil and gas properties in india . the approximately $ 2 . 9 billion portland general sale is also on target to close in late 2002 pending regulatory approvals . businesses under review these businesses are comprised of those operations outside our power and gas wholesale businesses and include global and industrial markets . while several of these businesses have very strong future prospects , we need to determine if their capital requirements and near - term growth prospects are sufficient enough in terms of earnings and cash generation . reviewing our businesses this way will help determine where we need to make reductions to our work force . more information will follow as soon as it becomes available . credit rating / 10 - q filing we continue to meet regularly with credit rating agencies and believe that our liquidity enhancements and scheduled asset sales will strengthen our balance sheet and maintain our investment grade credit rating . our current credit ratings by the three major rating agencies are as follows : - - moody ' s at baa 3 " under review for further downgrade " - - fitch at bbb - " evolving status " - - s or investor relations , enron corp . , enron building , 1400 smith street , houston , tx 77002 , phone : ( 713 ) 853 - 3956 , fax : ( 713 ) 646 - 3302 . in addition , the identity of the persons who , under sec rules , may be considered " participants in the solicitation " of dynegy and enron shareholders in connection with the proposed transactions , and any description of their direct or indirect interests , by security holdings or otherwise , are available in an sec filing under schedule 14 a made by each of dynegy and enron .
Subject: re : interest rates following the discussions i have had with louise and jay , this is the proposed solution to the interest rate risk management in newco . 1 . for the first few weeks ( to a few months ) we continue to use infinity to update the curves at 2 pm . i will need to have one trader to execute , mark curves and do any deals for foreign exchange ( cd $ etc . ) . louise , i hope you have this in your budget and headcount . i will need one junior trader ( and maybe two as things grow ) to help do this job . i have lined up one of the guys in the old trading desk , if this goes forward . 2 . in the first few weeks , jay webb and myself are hoping to acquire a lighter , and much simpler interest rate package which will allow us to do what we do , with significantly lower costs . we also will re - design the way we aggregate interest rate risk in the commodity books , to make it simpler and easier . to ensure there is no more discussion ever of drift - reallocation , i propose a method where , every desk head gets back his complete interest rate portfolio drift every month or quarter ( less any transaction expenses ) . i would expect that , the interest rate curve shift will be small till we build a somewhat longer dated portfolio , while the drift could start becoming substantial pretty quickly ( as we start making money ) . hope this answers the questions . we will have the curves at the right time , done by the trading group . we will still measure and manage our own exposure to both interest rates and currencies . we intend to allocate small var to that risk management . we would deal primarily with one or two counterparties - the parent bank and a couple of futures brokers to manage the risk . just to be very clear , while i am happy to manage this risk ( with extra help ) , i am primarily interested in the running of power options and structured products . harry ps - i cant find jeffrey gossett in the email system , stacey can you forward the email to him ( i dont know if he is an ene employee ) - - - - - original message - - - - - from : kitchen , louise sent : monday , january 07 , 2002 2 : 25 pm to : gossett , jeffrey c . ; arora , harry ; webb , jay cc : lavorato , john subject : re : interest rates harry / jay , can you help come to some conclusion on this . - - - - - original message - - - - - from : gossett , jeffrey c . sent : monday , january 07 , 2002 12 : 49 pm to : lavorato , john ; kitchen , louise subject : interest rates john / louise - given that under the current plan , the bank will be trading our interest rate risk , i doubt we are taking an interest rate trader to newco . in order to get the books run we will need an interest rate curve . should i plan on just getting access to reuters and setting a curve off of libor on my own ? jeff

Subject: re : hiring practices for summer interns charlene , thanks for the email . i have talked with sally several times on this last couple of days and i understand that ou has a different recruiting schedule then other schools . enron is on campus for recruiting in the near future and i have asked sally to tag on some interviews for summer interns while on that trip . i believe that she has been able to schedule this so i believe that from an ou perspective it may be a mute point now . doing that should be able to maintain the momentum that we have developed at ou and all the work lexi has done . by the way , the recruiting trip a couple of weeks ago was very successful . if you have any other questions or comments please let me know . mike charlene jackson @ enron 10 / 05 / 2000 06 : 34 am to : sally beck / hou / ect @ ect cc : celeste roberts / hou / ect @ ect , richard causey / corp / enron @ enron , mike mcconnell / hou / ect @ ect subject : re : hiring practices for summer interns sally , thanks for the e - mail regarding summer interns . i apologize that lexi and shelly were unable to provide you with the answers you were seeking . i wish that you had contacted either celeste or me to indicate that you were having difficulty . i have personally assured you on several occasions that i was available to either speak with you or meet with you if for some reason any member of my staff was not responsive . that being said please allow me to explain the recruiting strategy since i was instrumental in helping to set it . you are absolutely correct . it is great to do market research if time permits or it is regarding an issue of which we have little knowledge . as you are aware , over the past year we have engaged a professional recruiting firm ( brecker & merryman ) who has assisted us in a number of different market research projects . however , in my opinion , this issue is not one that required much research . i have been involved in recruiting in some way , shape or form at both the graduate and undergraduate level for the past 10 years . most major organizations , with the exception of the accounting firms , begin the summer intern recruiting process in early spring . there are actually some universities that do not allow recruitment of summer interns until after a certain date , particularly in the mba programs . for example , harvard does not allow an organization to come on campus and speak to first year students until january . as indicated , the firms that generally recruit in the fall are the accounting firms and they are primarily recruiting for " spring " internships . the recruiting strategy at enron is no different this year than it was last year with respect to summer interns . presentations were made in january however , because lexi has other school interviews that are already scheduled she will not be in a position to facilitate the interview process during the trip you have scheduled currently . as you are aware , in most instances , the dates for presentations and interviews are dictated by the respective universities and were secured in early august . if you would like for her to try and secure an interview schedule for a later date this fall she can certainly work with your schedule and her current schedule to support your efforts . i hope this has been helpful . i can understand and appreciate your frustration if you are not getting answers from the recruiter or her manager . again , i offer that i am available and willing to work with you if you are having difficulty with members of the program staff . please let me know what you decide about recruiting this fall for summer interns and whether i can be of any additional assistance . charlene

" i really have a good deal of confidence , but not an absolute guarantee , that we are going to be fine here , " said dynegy chief executive officer chuck watson , when pressed about the possibility of further troubling disclosures by enron . watson said dynegy had run the deal through worst - case scenarios and concluded that it made good business sense . investors apparently agreed , bidding up dynegy shares $ 5 . 55 , or 14 . 3 percent , to close at $ 44 . 31 on the new york stock exchange . enron shares gained 61 cents , to 7 . 1 percent , to $ 9 . 24 . the deal valued enron stock at $ 10 . 41 . enron agreed to a dynegy buyout after it was overwhelmed by a series of problems , including a u . s . regulatory probe into the off - balance sheet dealings , a $ 1 . 2 billion cut in shareholder equity and damaging credit rating downgrades . watson has cause for concern about new disclosures from enron , which last thursday said an internal probe showed its earnings had been overstated by some $ 600 million since 1997 . in a conference call with analysts on monday , dynegy executives emphasized their confidence in the future of the combined company , including annual projected earnings - per - share growth of 15 percent to 20 percent over the next three years . but they also fielded a barrage of questions about how well dynegy has insulated itself against further surprises of the kind that had slashed enron ' s market value last week to barely one - tenth the almost $ 80 billion it was valued in august 2000 . dynegy doubts huge liabilities to ensure against unpleasant disclosures , dynegy wrote so - called material adverse change clauses into the deal , allowing it to walk away from enron if there is serious deterioration of its businesses or assets . in particular , dynegy can turn its back on the deal if pending litigation against enron - including a stack of lawsuits filed by angry investors who have lost a fortune - leads to costs of more than $ 3 . 5 billion . chief financial officer rob doty said it was highly unlikely that this threshold would be reached , even if a " very substantial " settlement was reached in the stockholder suits . commerzbank securities analyst andre meade said he was not yet convinced that the stream of bad news from enron was over . " i think dynegy is making a big bet that they can successfully clean up the problems that enron has had , " he said . but ubs warburg analyst jay yannello said after hearing management discuss the deal , he was reassured it could address tough questions - a breath of fresh air after enron ' s tight - lipped response to investors . some analysts have said the deal could be thwarted by regulators because of concerns that dynegy would be too powerful after merging with enron , currently north america ' s biggest buyer and seller of both natural gas and electricity . watson said dynegy would have to work hard to explain the deal to regulators , led by the federal energy regulatory commission , but does not doubt it will eventually pass muster . " we really are confident that up and down the line we are going to be able to convince them that this is really in the best interest of the energy industry as well as these two respective companies , " he said . gas pipeline option , break - up fees dynegy executives also said there would be no complicated financing arrangements of the kind that triggered enron ' s downfall , and that the new dynegy will be able to keep top enron executives and traders from defecting to rival firms . enron officials declined to comment on reports that its banks j . p . morgan and citigroup were considering pumping an extra $ 500 million of capital in to enron . oil company chevrontexaco inc . , a major dynegy stockholder , has already agreed to inject $ 1 . 5 billion into enron immediately to keep it afloat while the merger is completed , which dynegy expects to take six to nine months . if enron backs out of the deal to accept a higher offer , it would have to pay a $ 350 million breakup fee to dyegy . and if the deal breaks down for any reason , dynegy would be allowed to exercise an option to acquire enron ' s northern natural gas pipeline subsidiary . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . usa : update 2 - enron , dynegy shares rise despite mixed reviews . 11 / 12 / 2001 reuters english news service ( c ) reuters limited 2001 . ( new third paragraph points out gap between enron stock price and value of dynegy offer ) by janet mcgurty new york , nov 12 ( reuters ) - shares of enron corp . climbed higher on monday on investor enthusiasm over last week ' s $ 9 billion bid by rival energy trader dynegy inc . to take over the beleaguered energy giant . dynegy gained $ 5 . 55 , or 14 . 3 percent , to $ 44 . 31 in afternoon trade on the new york stock exchange , while shares of enron rose 69 cents , or 8 percent , to $ 9 . 32 . the takeover announced friday halted a free - fall in enron ' s stock that lost about 75 percent of its market capitalization in the past month . however , enron ' s stock was trading well below the value of dynegy ' s offer of 0 . 2685 dynegy shares for each enron share , which translates into $ 11 . 94 per share . analysts said this likely reflected doubts in some investors minds as to whether the deal , which includes " escape clauses " for dynegy , will go through . some industry analysts said they were impressed by the upfront details offered by dynegy during a conference call with analysts , an about - face compared with calls with enron . a lack of transparency from enron about its off - balance sheet transactions , along with a u . s . regulatory investigation , had sparked widespread investor unease . " i would say that after listening to the conference call , i am even more comfortable with my initial judgment that the projections are conservative , " said jay yannello , an analyst with ubs warburg . earlier , yannello reiterated a " strong buy " on dynegy , saying while the brokerage does not underestimate the enormous challenge at hand , the takeover should yield the biggest and most credible energy merchant in the world . dynegy is about one - fifth the size of enron when measured by revenues . enron ' s woes came to light in mid - october after the biggest energy trader in north america disclosed that some of its off - balance sheet partners contributed to a $ 1 billion charge and a $ 1 . 2 billion reduction in shareholder equity . the takeover is an attractive transaction because of enron ' s trading operations , which combined with dynegy ' s above - board culture based on teamwork , strict values and honesty , should yield a formidable company , yannello said . " as dynegy continues to do due diligence , we continue to be comfortable with the fact that , if there was another shoe to drop , they have more than adequate protection in this arrangement to either absorb the impact of that event or to get out of the deal , in the worst case scenario . " he said . " we view the both the near and long - term upside potential of this deal as staggering , " he added . low risks , high rewards however , last week some antitrust lawyers said the deal will be closely examined by the federal trade commission because of the combined company ' s market share in energy trading , said steve newborn , formerly in charge of ftc merger enforcement . on monday , ratings agency fitch downgraded the ratings of marlin and osprey , two enron ' s off - balance sheet partnerships , covering about $ 3 . 3 billion in senior secured notes , on a deterioration of enron ' s credit profile . " we lowered our ratings to be consistent with actions we have taken on enron , " said fitch credit analyst ralph pellecchia , who added he is not aware of any material impact the moves could have on enron . the downgrade was expected . gordon howald , an analyst at credit lyonnaise securities , also said he is favorably disposed toward the takeover , which he called a " low risk - high reward proposition . " the most critical component is the immediate $ 1 . 5 billion equity infusion by dynegy shareholder chevrontexaco into enron will bolster enron and help keep it viable . " it appears . . . that dynegy has enough ' out ' clauses to at least protect itself if it decides not to pursue this transaction in the future , " said howald . however , howald said he is not convinced this is an offensive move by dynegy , but rather a defensive to move to protect itself and the industry from a potential enron bankruptcy . but even if it is defensive , dynegy walks away from the deal with the rights to enron ' s northern natural gas pipeline , which produced about about half of enron ' s pipeline earnings , and $ 350 million in cash , he said . doubts persist some analysts are less sanguine . they said dynegy is making a big bet that it can successfully clean up enron ' s balance sheet problems as well as integrate its trading and marketing business without losing a lot of key traders and volumes . " enron ' s principal - and most valuable asset - is its traders . and those people are mobile , " said andre mead , an analyst at commerzbank who said that he expects a six - to nine - month period of uncertainty in which both companies could lose their key trading personnel . meade also said that enron ' s restatement of earnings has called into question the quality and sources of its earnings . " i am not convinced that all the bad news related to those off - balance sheet vehicles are out and all disclosures concerning those entities have been made , " he said . " dynegy put some bearish assumptions in there when they decided to bid for enron . but the jury is out , enron is a deeply troubled company , " he said . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . some arb traders view enron stock as too risky to buy by janet whitman of dow jones newswires 11 / 12 / 2001 dow jones news service ( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones 201 - 938 - 5248 ; janet . whitman @ dowjones . com copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . energy companies still shy on enron despite dynegy deal by jon kamp , john edmiston and andrew dowell of dow jones newswires 11 / 12 / 2001 dow jones energy service ( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones & company , inc . ) new york - ( dow jones ) - credit concerns led u . s . energy companies to continue to restrict their dealings with enron corp .

( dyn ) . trading counterparties in enron ' s core north american electricity and natural gas markets said they were only doing necessary transactions and low - risk , short - term deals with the houston - based giant as they monitored developments with enron ' s credit rating . " as of last week , our value at risk to enron was down considerably from where it once was , " said al butkus , spokesman for aquila corp . ( ila ) , a leading trader of north american power and gas . " it ' s down even further today . " in comments similar to those made by others in the market , butkus said aquila wants to see an improvement in enron ' s credit rating and won ' t increase its exposure on the strength of the dynegy announcement alone . the $ 8 . 85 billion dynegy buyout announced friday isn ' t a done deal , and enron remains a serious credit risk if the deal doesn ' t go through , a power trader working in the markets east of the rockies said . " there just seems to be some concern that dynegy has quite a few opportunities to get out of it , " the trader said . added another , " this announcement hasn ' t changed anything . " enron spokesman eric thode said , to the contrary , that the company has seen a " dramatic " increase in trading business monday from levels seen at the end of last week . " today ' s figures are on line to be much larger than thursday or friday , " thode said . " the certainty now of the deal with dynegy takes away those fears , those question marks . " volumes on enrononline , the company ' s internet - based trading platform , are expected to top 5 , 000 transactions monday , up from around 4 , 000 thursday and friday and near the 30 - day rolling average of 5 , 600 to 5 , 800 , thode said . volumes at the beginning of last week topped 6 , 000 , he said . to be sure , traders generally saw the dynegy buyout announcement as a sign enron ' s prospects have improved , and traders in some regions said they were seeing more normal activity on enrononline after last week ' s reduced volumes . still , credit concerns are preventing many in the market from doing business with enron . standard & poor ' s and moody ' s investors service rate enron ' s credit at the lowest level of investment grade , and both have the company on negative credit watch or review for a downgrade . in the absence of a deal with dynegy or one like it , enron ' s ratings would fall into junk - bond territory , s & p analysts said on a conference call monday . as reported , dynegy ' s acquisition agreement allows the company to walk away if enron ' s additional legal and financial liabilities exceed $ 3 . 5 billion . there also are other " material adverse change " provisions , officials said . the energy markets and ratings agencies are also waiting for dynegy to make good on its pledge to inject $ 1 . 5 billion immediately into enron to shore up its finances . an infusion of cash would be a " stabilizing event , " moody ' s said last week . charlie sanchez , an energy marketing manager at gilber 201 - 938 - 4430 ; andrew . dowell @ dowjones . com ( jon kamp in chicago and john edmiston in houston contributed to this article . ) copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . dynegy , enron officials confident merger will clear scrutiny by juan a . lozano associated press writer 11 / 12 / 2001 associated press newswires copyright 2001 . the associated press . all rights reserved . houston ( ap ) - executives of dynegy inc . and enron corp . believe their plan to merge the nation ' s two dominant energy marketing companies will overcome federal antitrust scrutiny , leading to a completed deal by next summer . " we really are confident that up and down the line we will be able to convince ( federal regulators ) this is in the best interest of the energy industry and the two companies , " said chuck watson , chairman and chief executive officer of dynegy . investors pleased with the deal to bail out the once mighty but now troubled enron sent the shares of both companies soaring monday - in midday trading enron shares were up 10 . 5 percent , and dynegy shares rose 12 percent . steve bergstrom , dynegy ' s president , said the closest regulatory scrutiny would come from the federal energy regulatory commission , but that he expected all antitrust hurdles would be cleared within the next six to nine months . the deal , worth at least $ 9 billion , was announced friday . dynegy also will assume $ 13 billion of enron debt . enron became a takeover target after its stock plunged about 80 percent in recent weeks because of concerns that the nation ' s top buyer and seller of natural gas wasn ' t revealing serious financial problems to shareholders . dynegy officials pledged monday that they won ' t tolerate the sort of financial practices that prompted enron to acknowledge last week that it overstated earnings by about 20 percent since 1997 and kept more than half a billion dollars in debt off the company ' s books . those financial practices included business partnerships now under investigation by the securities and exchange commission . " dynegy will manage the new company in the way we ' ve managed the old company . we will substantially simplify the balance sheet , " said rob doty , dynegy ' s chief financial officer . after the merger is completed , the enron name will disappear . watson will serve as chairman and chief executive of the combined company . dynegy ' s stockholders will own about 64 percent of the new company and enron ' s stockholders will hold the rest . enron ' s stock price began to free fall after enron announced a $ 618 million third quarter loss on oct . 16 and disclosed a $ 1 . 2 billion reduction in shareholder equity related to the partnerships . that was followed by news of the sec investigation . enron responded by firing its chief financial officer , andrew fastow , who ran the partnerships , and scrambled to get cash and increase credit lines to regain investor confidence . investors didn ' t respond and dumped enron shares , sending its stock plummeting . the deal to merge the companies was announced after the stock markets closed on friday , and investors reacted positively to the news monday . in midday trading , dynegy shares rose $ 4 . 63 to $ 43 . 39 on the new york stock exchange . enron shares were up 91 cents to $ 9 . 54 on the nyse - but still much lower than the 52 - week high of $ 84 . 87 . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . dynegy call - 4 : held talks with ratings agencies 11 / 12 / 2001 dow jones news service ( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones & company , inc . ) dynegy ' s bergstrom said he expects the acquisition of enron will receive the needed regulatory approvals and close within the next six to nine months . in addition to approval by the securities and exchange commission , the deal must be approved by the federal energy regulatory commission .

" the company is not in danger of imminent bankruptcy , or default , " said ron barone , an s & p analyst . however , the s & p read on investor confidence is that " enron is not all that viable right now , " said one analyst . s & p analysts stated that they might not fully understand all the enron partnerships . " there is a little uncertainty about all the partnerships that enron has , " said barone . but , s & p analysts added , they did understand the financial impact of the partnerships that have been disclosed . enron stock and bonds have been battered since the company revealed the extent of its dealings with partnerships set up and run by its former chief financial officer , andrew fastow . while s & p is assuming enron has disclosed all the relevant information about those partnerships , there may be more details forthcoming as a special committee established by enron goes about its work , they added . s & p ' s downgrade to of enron to triple - b - minus was due to an erosion of investor confidence , analysts stressed . and , the enron negative creditwatch " was a heads - up to enron counterparties , " said an analyst . s & p analysts said that despite the decision to place dynegy on negative creditwatch , the ratings could remain at the same level , at triple - b . for that to happen , it will be necessary for dynegy to dispose of non - core assets that " could impair the new dynegy balance sheet , " said an s 201 - 938 - 2008 ; michael . barr @ dowjones . com - by christine richard ; dow jones newswires , 201 - 938 - 2189 ; christinerichard @ dowjones . com copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . india : utilities to value enron ' s indian assets - lender . 11 / 12 / 2001 reuters english news service ( c ) reuters limited 2001 . bombay , nov 12 ( reuters ) - two indian private utilities will start valuing dabhol power co ' s assets in a few days as a prelude to possibly buying u . s . energy major enron corp ' s majority stake , the industrial development bank of india ( idbi ) said on monday . the tata power co and bses ltd wish to start " due diligence " - inspect the financial records and operations with a view to arriving at a offer price - of dabhol ' s $ 2 . 9 billion power plant on the west coast of india , the project ' s lead lender said in a statement . enron has been seeking to exit the project since may , but its task of finding a buyer has taken on more urgency after its desperate financial troubles at home . the largest u . s . energy trader has agreed to be bought out by a smaller rival , dynegy inc , as it tries to salvage its crumbling business empire . idbi ' s statement comes after three days of closed - door negotiations at the weekend in singapore between the indian lenders ' representatives and enron . officials from tata power , india ' s largest private power company , and another leading private utility , bses ltd , also attended the meeting . the two companies have emerged as potential candidates for buying the entire 85 percent foreign holding in dabhol , which was to build and run the 2 , 184 mw plant , the country ' s largest foreign direct investment . enron owns 65 percent of dabhol , general electric co and bechtel corp own 10 percent each , and the maharashtra state electricity board holds the remaining 15 percent . " the sale price of the shareholding of enron and its associates in dpc would be decided by the concerned parties through mutual negotiations , " the statement from idbi said . officials at the lending institutions said that given its troubles at home , enron could now be willing to sell its stake at a considerable discount . indian banks and institutions have provided loans and guarantees of around $ 1 . 4 billion to the plant . old dispute the first phase of enron ' s controversial indian project has been completed , but work on the second phase was abruptly stopped in june following a bitter dispute between enron and a local utility , the maharashtra state electricity board , the plant ' s sole buyer . the cash - strapped indian utility had in 1995 contracted to buy all the power from dabhol but it later said it did not need all the power and that it was too costly . while dabhol has said it would prefer to resolve its dispute with the board amicably , it felt the discussions with the power plant ' s indian lenders and the government were not progressing . if the current round of negotiations do not bear fruit , enron may terminate the contract and file for damages in the international court of arbitration in london . the country ' s largest term lender , idbi and other indian lenders in the consortium like icici ltd and state bank of india have already moved an indian court to prevent dpc from issuing a final notice to terminate its contract with the loss - making board . they fear that if enron is unable to sell its stake and terminates its contract with the utility , it could end up defaulting on its loans . dabhol served a preliminary notice in may to terminate the project and can serve a final notice if a six - month cooling - off period fails to produce a solution . that six month deadline ends on november 19 . copyright ?

" we view the both the near and long - term upside potential of this deal as staggering , " he said . gordon howald , an analyst at credit lyonnaise securities , also said he is favorably disposed toward the takeover , which he called a " low risk / high reward proposition . " the most critical component is the immediate $ 1 . 5 billion equity infusion by dynegy shareholder chevrontexaco into enron will bolster enron and help keep it viable . " it appears . . . that dynegy has enough ' out ' clauses to at least protect itself if it decides not to pursue this transaction in the future , " said howald . however , howald said he is not convinced this is indeed an offensive move on dynegy ' s part , but rather a defensive to move to protect itself and the industry from a potential enron bankruptcy . but even if it is defensive , dynegy walks away from the deal with the rights to enron ' s northern natural gas pipeline , which produced about about half of enron ' s pipeline earnings , and $ 350 million in cash , he said . carol coale , an analyst with prudential financial in houston who maintained a buy rating on dynegy remains skeptical on the outcome of the merger , which looks good on paper but hinges on the certainty of enron ' s future earnings per share . she said because enron restated its net income over the past four years , " we believe the accounting basis for other complex financial transactions will be called into question .

( dyn ) chairman chuck watson said he sees " nothing but upside " ahead from the company ' s planned acquisition of enron corp . ( ene ) , which was announced late friday . in addition to being a sound strategic move , the deal " injects confidence into the energy markets , " said watson , founder of the houston energy trading firm , in a conference call held monday to discuss the $ 8 . 85 billion takeover of enron . on friday , dynegy confirmed the widely speculated deal by announcing it would buy its cross - town rival in a stock swap that values each enron share at 0 . 2685 of a dynegy share . the sale of enron for only a quarter of its share price a month ago , or just a quarter of its all - time high of $ 90 a share reached just last year , follows an abrupt turn in enron ' s fortunes . last week , enron , which is the nation ' s biggest trader of natural gas and electricity , admitted its financial statements going back to 1997 couldn ' t be relied upon and would have to be restated . the company made accounting errors in recording transactions from some of its limited partnerships . the company also misstated its level of debt and its shareholder equity over this period . enron ' s partnership dealings are being investigated by the securities and exchange commission , and have sparked a number of shareholder lawsuits . over the past month , new revelations about enron ' s web of partnerships and off - balance sheet financing vehicles have been uncovered almost daily . during the conference call , kenneth lay , enron ' s chairman and chief executive , said it was a " very reflective time " for him . when lay transformed enron from a natural gas pipeline company into a dynamic energy trading company that was a darling on wall street , this was clearly not what he had in mind . lay said , " i didn ' t expect to create the world ' s next leading energy trading company by merging enron into another company . " enron officials said they were continuing their internal investigations of its accounting practices . " we have disclosed anything and everything we have found so far , " lay said . enron president and chief operating officer greg whalley , who will remain with dynegy after the merger as an executive vice president , said enron will host a conference call " later this week " to further discuss recent events at the company . the call will likely be held on wednesday , he said . in light of the uncertainty surrounding enron ' s financial dealings , it is not surprising that quite a number of questions during the conference call focused on the company ' s liquidity and the potential liabilities dynegy would assume in the transaction . dynegy ' s acquisition agreement allows the company to walk away if enron ' s additional legal and financial liabilities exceed $ 3 . 5 billion . there also are other " material adverse change , " or mac , provisions , officials said . upon the closing of the acquisition , dynegy expects to post reserves to cover the cost of outstanding litigation , said dynegy ' s doty . " we believe we have adequately bracketed the downside , " said dynegy ' s watson . " there has to be a substantial , substantial material change in what we already know . . . i don ' t want to minimize the impact . that ' s why we have mac outs . " according to dynegy ' s bergstrom , the economics of the transaction assumed the potential risk from outstanding lawsuits . " even in that worst - case there is a substantial amount of economic value here , " watson said . dynegy expects to continue its due diligence in the months leading up to the deal ' s close , bergstrom said . dynegy ' s examination of the business so far has turned up " no surprises " in enron ' s core energy trading business , bergstrom said . however , the merger agreement has provisions in case the company ' s examination does reveal any , bergstrom said . " we don ' t expect to find anything material , " he said , adding that enron ' s core energy business is " very , very strong . " based on its current information , dynegy expects the acquisition to increase earnings by 35 % , or between 90 cents to 95 cents a share , before taking into account expected merger cost savings . as a result , dynegy now expects its full year pro forma earnings for 2002 to be in the range of $ 3 . 40 to $ 3 . 50 a share . according to thomson financial / first call , analysts were expecting dynegy to earn $ 2 . 57 a share next year . in 2000 , the company earned $ 1 . 43 a share before items . dynegy has estimated cost savings from the acquisition at between $ 400 million to $ 500 million . the ratio of stock enron shareholders will be paid is fixed and there is no collar to limit its range , said a dynegy spokeswoman . there isn ' t a walkaway provision , but if the deal is terminated , dynegy will own rights to enron ' s northern natural gas pipeline because of the $ 1 . 5 billion cash infusion it will provide to the company immediately . dynegy able to give enron the cash infusion immediately because chevrontexaco corp . ( cvx ) , which owns slightly more than a fourth of dynegy , will invest $ 2 . 5 billion in dynegy . the deal has a $ 350 million " topping fee , " a dynegy spokeswoman said . she explained that if either party decided to terminated the transaction , that party would owe the other the " topping fee " if it were acquired by another party . dynegy ' s bergstrom said he expects the acquisition of enron will receive the needed regulatory approvals and close within the next six to nine months . in addition to approval by the securities and exchange commission , the deal must be approved by the federal energy regulatory commission . " we expect ferc to be the pacesetter , " bergstrom said . until the deal closes , dynegy expects enron will have " sufficient interim liquidity , " doty said . " ( the cash infusion ) should immediately put to rest the liquidity concerns . " based on conversations dynegy had with the leading credit rating agencies management expects enron ' s ratings to remain investment grade , doty said . meanwhile , dynegy ' s ratings are expected to be affirmed at their current ratings , but be placed on watch for a downgrade until the transaction is completed , he said . according to doty , dynegy expects its debt - to - capital ratio will be below 40 % after the acquisition closes . enron said it wouldn ' t comment on reports published in the wall street journal monday that said its bankers , j . p . morgan chase 201 - 938 - 5166 ; christina . cheddar @ dowjones . com copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . usa : enron advisors seen mulling investment - wsj . 11 / 12 / 2001 reuters english news service ( c ) reuters limited 2001 . new york , nov 12 ( reuters ) - enron corp . advisors j . p . morgan chase & co . and citigroup inc . are considering investments of $ 250 million each in the troubled energy trading giant , the wall street journal said on monday . citing people familiar with the matter , the newspaper said word of the possible investment helped bolster enron ' s financial outlook while it negotiated the $ 9 billion merger with dynegy inc . announced late on friday . such a move would be unusual , as investment bankers traditionally don ' t put money into takeover deals they help negotiate , the journal said . but it quoted its sources as saying word of the possible investments may have helped fend off a possible deal - breaking downgrade of enron ' s debt by moody ' s investor services . on potential stumbling block to the dynegy deal is the concern of credit - rating agencies , particularly moody ' s , about the worsening financial condition of enron , the journal said . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . duke is owed about $ 100 mln by enron , executive says ( update 2 ) 2001 - 11 - 12 17 : 07 ( new york ) duke is owed about $ 100 mln by enron , executive says ( update 2 ) ( adds duke ' s off - balance sheet debt in sixth paragraph . ) charlotte , nov . 12 ( bloomberg ) - - duke energy corp . , the largest u . s . utility owner , said it is owed about $ 100 million from energy trading with enron corp . ` ` exposure that duke has to enron is not material , ' ' jim donnell , chief executive of duke ' s u . s . trading unit , duke energy north america , said on a conference call . ` ` the vast majority of our transactions ' ' are backed by cash or a bank , he said . ` ` for those that aren ' t , our maximum exposure is no more than $ 100 million . we continue to trade with enron today as we have in the past .

' ' the purchase will add 90 to 95 cents a share to earnings in 2002 , dynegy predicted friday . dynegy , which had been expected to earn $ 2 . 57 next year , now expects 2002 earnings of $ 3 . 40 to $ 3 . 50 . dynegy will have net income of more than $ 2 billion in 2003 if the merger closes , chris ellinghaus , an energy analyst at williams capital group , said in a report . dynegy ' s 2000 net income was $ 501 million . chevrontexaco backing robert doty , dynegy ' s chief financial officer , today predicted enron will keep its investment - grade rating until the acquisition is completed . doty said he expects a mid - ` bbb ' credit rating for the combined company , near the lowest investment grade . if the rating falls below investment grade , enron could be forced to buy back bonds early from partnerships for as much as $ 3 . 3 billion . a key element to moody ' s maintaining its rating and backing the buyout was chevrontexaco corp . ' s support , watson said . chevrontexaco will provide $ 1 . 5 billion to enron immediately and $ 1 billion to dynegy after the merger closes . chevrontexaco , the second - biggest u . s . oil company , owns 26 percent of dynegy . by stepping in , it reassured investors that dynegy would have enough money to operate after the merger , even if all the problems with enron ' s partnerships have not been disclosed , analysts and company officials said . ` ` i can ' t emphasize enough how important our relationship with chevron is to this company , ' ' watson said . enron has been battling a cash crunch and a loss of investor confidence because of questions about partnerships it started and put under the control of its senior executives . investors feared the company was using the partnerships to hide losses and debt . before today , its stock had plunged 90 percent this year . ` financial noise ' last week , enron restated earnings for four years to include losses from affiliated partnerships , reducing earnings by $ 586 million . in an interview after the merger was announced , watson said he ' s convinced enron ' s trading operations are sound and described disclosures about affiliated partnerships as ` ` financial noise . ' ' enron ' s trading provides 97 percent of its revenue . ` ` all the financial noise about the partnerships , maybe it has damaged the enron brand a bit , ' ' watson said . ` ` but i ' ll tell you what it hasn ' t impacted , and that ' s the high regard that the industry places on ' ' enron ' s trading business , he said . if the acquisition is completed , dynegy will get enron ' s energy - advising business , which helps other companies find ways to cut electricity and natural - gas costs . dynegy has been trying to develop that business on its own , said jim walline , a fund manager with lutheran brotherhood , which owned about 306 , 000 dynegy shares and 93 , 000 enron shares on sept . 30 . the rise in dynegy ' s share price increased the offer ' s value to $ 11 . 85 , one - fourth enron ' s average stock price over the last 12 months . ` ` for dynegy it looks like a steal , ' ' walline said . dynegy can cancel the acquisition if enron ' s legal liabilities exceed $ 3 . 5 billion , doty said . that amount includes possible awards against enron because of shareholder lawsuits . shareholders have accused enron executives of improperly profiting from the partnerships , and of not disclosing the effects on the company ' s earnings . protecting shareholders ` ` i fully believe management has thought of every downside scenario to protect dynegy shareholders , ' ' said james yannello , an analyst at ubs warburg . he rates dynegy ` ` strong buy ' ' and doesn ' t own its shares . ` ` i think the odds of exhausting that $ 3 . 5 billion cushion are very low . ' ' dynegy officials said they don ' t plan to form limited partnerships similar to those formed by enron . ` ` we will run this company much more conservatively from a financial point of view and wouldn ' t expect anything like this to happen in the future , ' ' doty said . enron doesn ' t expect to find more losses from the partnerships or affiliated companies it already has in place , enron chief financial officer jeffrey mcmahon said . ` ` could there be more ? possibly , ' ' mcmahon said . ` ` do we expect more ? no . we ' ve done an awful lot of work , but it ' s fair to say the investigation remains ongoing . ' ' moody ' s investors service on friday lowered its rating on enron ' s long - term debt to ` ` baa 3 , ' ' one notch above junk . the credit - ratings company today placed dynegy and its illinova utility units under review for a possible downgrade because of the enron buyout . energy traders began limiting trade with enron last month because its plunging stock price prompted concerns about creditworthiness . some said today that they haven ' t resumed normal dealings . ` ` we ' re continuing to trade with them on a very limited basis , and we ' ll continue to do so until the proposed dynegy buyout develops further , ' ' said james peters , a spokesman for atlanta - based energy trader mirant corp . , an enron and dynegy competitor . asset sales dynegy officials said they intend to sell enron ' s non - trading assets , though they haven ' t set a timeline for the sales . the company said it expects to get regulator approval of the deal in six to nine months . dynegy chief operating officer stephen bergstrom said he expects u . s . federal energy regulatory commission approval to come last . ` ` the market ' s a lot bigger than enron , ' ' mirant ' s peters said . on friday , dynegy said it will have annual revenue of more than $ 200 billion , more than 22 , 000 megawatts of electric generating capacity and 25 , 000 miles of pipeline after the merger . the company will save as much as $ 500 million a year before tax by ` ` winding down ' ' enron ' s business outside of trading and pipelines and cutting costs , dynegy said . ` ` if ( the buyout happens ) , you ' d have one of the most attractive energy - related companies in the world , ' ' said donald coxe , who manages 78 , 000 enron shares in the harris insight equity fund . dynegy ' s charles watson ( transcript of interview ) 2001 - 11 - 12 16 : 30 ( new york ) * * * * the following is an unofficial transcript . * * * * bloomberg l . p . does not guarantee the accuracy of this transcript . new york , nov . 12 ( bloomberg ) - - the following is a transcript of a bloomberg interview with charles watson , chief executive officer of dynegy inc . the reporter is dean shepherd . shepherd : back to what would have been our top story , before news of that plane crash . dynegy says it is convinced that enron ' s trading operations are sound . the company agreed late friday , as you know , to buy its rival for $ 23 billion in stock and debt . the terms of the deal break down like this : dynegy investors will get about 10 . 40 a share for each enron share . that ' s a 21 percent premium , based on friday ' s closing price . last week , enron restated its earnings for four years - actually , a bit more than that , to include losses from three affiliated partnerships . and taking a look at how enron shares are trading right now , there you see enron continuing to rally , picking up another 99 cents to 9 . 62 . dynegy up sharply - up 5 . 24 to $ 44 even . and joining us here in the studio is chuck watson , the chairman and ceo of dynegy . chuck , good morning . watson : good morning . shepherd : good to see you again . watson : good to see you . shepherd : why buy enron ? why buy into what , from all appearances over the last month , has been a mess ? watson : well , i think it ' s important to understand that the mess that everybody is talking about was not in their core business . the mess is on the partnerships and the litigation surrounding those partnerships . the core business has really not been materially impacted . and we knew that , being in the business and being counterparties to enron for some time . so we had a little bit of a competitive advantage , in terms of looking at this , because we ' re in a unique position . i mean , we know the people . we ' re right there in houston . they ' re right across the street from us . we know a lot of the people . we didn ' t think the core business was affected . they have a tremendous pipeline operation that ' s been an outstanding leader for years . and they ' ve got this market trading organization in north america and in europe . and what we viewed was the core business , which we would retain , was very sound and pristine and , in fact , it is and it ' s the investments outside - some inside the u . s . and outside of the u . s . that have not been stellar . shepherd : i wondered , as i ' ve sat in this very chair last week and reported that enron was restating its earnings , i wondered out loud whether they were restating as a result of you going in and - with your team and taking a look at their books ? watson : no , that ' s not true . actually , they ' ve got a - had an internal investigation going on for some time , which provided us a lot of comfort , as well , because we have the benefit of that , that had been going on for weeks , before we even got in there . so it had clearly been something that they were doing on their own . i think they ' ve been as forthcoming as they can . as soon as they know the facts , they ' ve been reporting them . and we had - and we actually wanted to get that information out because all that has been , you know , boiled into the economics of this transaction . shepherd : what portions of the business do you expect to shed ? watson : well , obviously , they ' ve already had about $ 4 billion of assets up for sale , including portland general , it ' s about 3 billion of that . shepherd : right . watson : and then most of the international assets , we ' ll take a hard look at . it ' s not really core to dynegy and , really , to this transaction . but one of the things that we ' ve done by inserting with the chevron texaco and chevron ' s $ 2 . 5 billion and $ 1 . 5 billion up front with the other money that enron ' s being able to raise , that will give us some time . we don ' t have to have a fire sale or anything , but fundamentally , the assets outside the u . s . are something that were - are not core to our business . shepherd : are you satisfied that all of the bad news is out ? are you satisfied there ' s not something they ' re hiding in there that ' s going to throw a curve at you ? watson : well , i ' ll tell you , as i said , they ' ve had internal investigation going on for a while . we ' ve had some of the smartest attorneys we know in there and accountants , and there ' s been an awful lot of work done in this . and everything that they ' ve found has been disclosed . we , obviously , don ' t expect anything else , but to protect our shareholders , of course , we ' ve got some material adverse changes conditions that , you know , could get us out of the transaction if we do , you know , find something . shepherd : so you can walk away , if you see something that . watson : sure . shepherd : how tough is it going to be to win regulatory approval ? there ' s a lot of speculation that you ' re really going to have your hands full convincing regulators that this is a doable deal . watson : well , you know , there ' s several different regulatory groups . but if you think about it , the - from an asset standpoint , their pipeline operation , interstate pipeline operation , we don ' t have one of those , so there ' s really not any overlap of assets . so the discussion really would be around the size of their marketing group and ours . but if you look at the percentage of the market , which is somewhat difficult to determine , this is going to be a formidable competitor , but there ' s a bunch of competitors out there . there ' s a very liquid market . there ' s no one company that ' s ever going to have any particular grasp or control of energy markets . shepherd : how long do you figure it ' ll take you to get the deal done ? watson : well , we ' re hoping that about six months , maybe nine . but you know , we ' re not taking lightly the regulatory approvals that we have . we just think we can work through the issues and , hopefully , we ' ll get it done in six to nine months . shepherd : all right . chuck watson , thanks so much for joining us today . watson : thank you . shepherd : we appreciate your time . watson : appreciate it . dynegy sees enron rating remaining investment grade ( update 5 ) 2001 - 11 - 12 11 : 57 ( new york ) dynegy sees enron rating remaining investment grade ( update 5 ) ( adds dynegy expects mid - bbb rating for combined company in third paragraph and moody ' s reviews dynegy for downgrade in last . ) houston , nov . 12 ( bloomberg ) - - enron corp . , which is being bought by rival energy trader dynegy inc . , will keep its investment grade rating until the acquisition is completed , dynegy ' s chief financial officer predicted . enron ' s stock rose as much as 20 percent , and dynegy gained as much as 16 percent . ` ` from now until closing , we believe enron will maintain its investment grade ratings , although on the weak end of investment grade , ' ' dynegy cfo robert doty said on a conference call with analysts and investors . doty said he expects a mid - ` bbb ' credit rating for the combined company . dynegy agreed friday to buy enron for at least $ 23 billion in stock and assumed debt , ending a financial crisis that threatened to bankrupt enron , the largest energy trader . dynegy will pay more than $ 8 billion in stock and assume $ 15 billion in debt . ` ` if ( the buyout happens ) , you ' d have one of the most attractive energy - related companies in the world , ' ' said donald coxe , who manages 78 , 000 enron shares in the harris insight equity fund . a federal investigation of enron ' s accounting limited its ability to finance its daily trading business . dynegy can cancel its purchase if it determines enron ' s legal liabilities exceed $ 3 . 5 billion , doty said . that amount includes possible shareholder lawsuits . ` every downside scenario ' ` ` i fully believe management has thought of every downside scenario to protect dynegy shareholders , ' ' said jay yannello , an analyst at ubs warburg . he rates dynegy ` ` strong buy ' ' and doesn ' t own its shares . ` ` i think the odds of exhausting that $ 3 . 5 billion cushion are very low .

' ' officials also said dynegy doesn ' t plan to form limited partnerships similar to those formed by enron , which brought increased scrutiny to the company ' s finances and helped push its stock down 75 percent since oct . 16 . ` more conservatively ' ` ` we will run this company much more conservatively from a financial point of view and wouldn ' t expect anything like this to happen in the future , ' ' doty said . enron doesn ' t expect to find more losses from other such partnerships or affiliated companies , enron chief financial officer jeffrey mcmahon said . ` ` could there be more , possibly , ' ' mcmahon said . ` ` do we expect more , no . we ' ve done an awful lot of work , but it ' s fair to say the investigation remains ongoing .

' s trading operations are sound and described disclosures about affiliated partnerships that helped drive enron ' s stock down 67 percent in three weeks as ` ` financial noise . ' ' dynegy agreed friday to buy enron for at least $ 23 billion , including at least $ 8 billion in stock and $ 15 billion in assumed debt . dynegy shares rose as much as 16 percent today . enron rose as much as 20 percent . in an interview after the merger announcement , watson and enron chairman kenneth lay discussed how the houston - based companies reached agreement less than three weeks after enron ' s shares began plunging . ` ` all the financial noise about the partnerships , maybe it has damaged the enron brand a bit , ' ' watson said . ` ` but i ' ll tell you what it hasn ' t impacted , and that ' s the high regard that the industry places on ' ' enron ' s trading business , he said . enron last week restated earnings for four years to include losses from three affiliated partnerships , reducing earnings by $ 586 million . six employees , out of enron ' s 20 , 000 , may have improperly benefited from the partnerships , lay said . ` ` i ' m sorry those six people seem to have gone somewhat over the edge in their dealings or transactions , but you can ' t be absolutely protected from that in any business , ' ' he said . lost effectiveness lay didn ' t specify which six people he was referring to . he removed andrew fastow , who helped set up and ran many of the affiliated partnerships , as chief financial officer on oct . 24 . an enron securities filing says fastow made more than $ 30 million off two of the partnerships . fastow ` ` had lost his effectiveness because of all the press coverage ' ' on the affiliates , lay said . treasurer ben glisan and kristina mordaunt , a managing director and a corporate counsel for an enron division , also were fired , enron said in a corporate filing on thursday . former employees michael kopper , kathy lynn and anne yeager were in a position to profit from partnerships , the filing said . ` ` you trust people , you accept their representations and proposals , ' ' lay said . ` ` sometimes when you do that , you get surprised and disappointed . ' ' both executives said they expect antitrust regulators to approve the merger because the two companies own different types of assets and won ' t dominate any market . ` ` there really isn ' t anything that lays on top of each other , ' ' watson said friday night . ` ` we ' re not in the pipeline business and they are . we ' re in the generation business , and they ' re really not . ' ' dynegy shares rose 6 . 2 percent on friday after terms of the enron purchase leaked to the press . watson expects the acquisition to add 90 cents to 95 cents a share , or 35 percent , to dynegy ' s 2002 earnings . enron is selling for $ 10 . 41 a share , one - fifth the average price over the past 12 months . enron stock climbed 97 cents , or 11 percent , to $ 9 . 60 in late morning trading . earlier , they touched $ 10 . 38 . dynegy rose $ 4 . 54 , or 12 percent , to $ 43 . 30 after touching $ 45 . cash crunch the rapid decline of enron threatened to bankrupt the company and disrupt energy markets . enron handles an estimated one - quarter of u . s . electricity and natural - gas trades . a falling credit rating made it difficult for the company to raise capital needed to back trades . as part of the purchase , chevrontexaco corp . , which owns 26 percent of dynegy , agreed to provide enron with $ 2 . 5 billion . ` ` what we found when looked under the hood is that the core of enron was still there and working as well as ever , ' ' watson said . ` ` that business was pristine and had nothing to do with the partnerships . ' ' dynegy began taking steps toward the acquisition in late october , when watson called lay to offer assistance with enron ' s growing financial crisis , the two men said . that led to a saturday morning meeting in lay ' s kitchen . ` ` he even made me a breakfast roll , ' ' watson said . ` ` he didn ' t eat it , ' ' lay said . lay said he won ' t be an active manager in the new company . watson said friday that he and lay hadn ' t discussed a severance package . as head of enron , lay had refocused the houston operator of u . s . natural - gas pipelines on trading and international expansion , boosting reported revenue 20 - fold since 1995 to $ 100 . 8 billion last year . he said he doesn ' t regret the strategy . ` ` clearly , enron has gotten involved in business that hasn ' t turned out well , ' ' lay said , pointing to money - losers azurix inc . , created to supply water and build related projects around the world , and newpower holdings inc . , a seller of electricity to homes and small businesses . ` ` but you have to keep in mind , too , that 12 years ago we weren ' t in the wholesale merchant ( trading ) business . today that ' s an incredibly valuable franchise . ' ' the trading business , which accounts for about 97 percent of enron ' s revenue , buys electricity , gas and other commodities from producers and sells them to end users such as utilities and industrial customers . it also advises big business customers on energy use and sells them gas and electricity . reassessing steel , lumber watson said the new company will keep trading coal , gas , power and petroleum products , and plans to expand by buying assets and using them to develop trading . ` ` we ' ll just have to reassess over time whether we stay in ' ' trading of steel , lumber and other non - energy commodities , he said . enron wants to shed its 65 percent stake in dabhol power co . in india , which is owed $ 64 million in overdue bills from a state government agency that has refused to pay the power prices enron was promised in contracts . ` ` we have strong legal remedies and we ' re heading down the path toward arbitration , but we ' d still very much like to work out a settlement with the government , ' ' lay said . potential buyers have balked at enron ' s $ 1 billion asking price for dabhol . neither man would comment on whether dynegy plans to cut jobs after the merger , or what will happen to the naming rights to enron field . the major league baseball stadium is home to the houston astros , and enron paid $ 100 million to have its name on the ballpark . ` ` the name of the company is now dynegy , ' ' watson said . dynegy ' s acquisition requires approval from u . s . securities , antitrust and energy regulators . watson expects soon to share details of the new dynegy with regulators from the european union and u . k . , where enron operates a trading desk and owns a water company and two power plants . ` ` i don ' t know if we are required to do so , but we will talk to them anyway , ' ' watson said . ` ` we don ' t think there are going to be any problems , ' ' lay said .

Subject: component var tanya , some stability tests were performed on the simulation . ( 1 ) the window size of the averaging in the simulation was changed from 10 to 20 for ng - price ( the biggest book in gas ) for effective date june - 28 . as you can see in the file 28 ng - price _ windowsize , the component var numbers are very similar . ( 2 ) to look at a calculational comparison , i looked at the storage - prc book ( which has no gamma position ) for effective date of 27 th and ( a ) calculated ffvols , and ( b ) calculated the riskmetrics var ( the correlations are very high across the term structure ) and compared to the component var code calculation , and again the two nubers are comparable , given the different modes of calculation . naveen

Subject: needles / topock price differentials i have had a casual chat with some of my accounts regarding their opinion of the market dynamics affecting the needles to topock price differentials . each customer focused more on the supply side dynamics of topock gas supplies , rather than the incremental intra - state transport costs required to transport to the pg & e citygate , as the primary driving force for the needles to topock price differential . here is a recurring theme i heard from my customers : the el paso merchant service ( epms ) 1 . 2 bcf contract ' s block ii capacity ( 500 mmcf / d of permian to pg & e / topock capacity , $ . 065 transport rate ) has a re - callable aspect . if epms schedules gas under the transport of block ii capacity to any other california delivery point other than pg & e / topock , then other parties may recall the capacity for their own use to pg & e / topock . currently duke has recalled 100 mmcf / d and pg & e energy trading has also recalled 100 mmcf / d for their use to transport permian gas to pg & e / topock . ( fyi - epmc may re - recall this capacity , but they have elected not to ) . these additional topock supplies coming from duke and pg & e energy trading under block ii capacity may be viewed as providing an oversupply of gas to pg & e at topock . this gas competes head to head with malin gas prices . for example , today ' s malin price is $ 4 . 62 while pg & e / topock price is $ 4 . 69 . today ' s cash price differential between needles and topock is $ . 60 , far larger than the previously assumed $ . 28 differential resulting from the intrastate cost required to bring topock gas to the citygate . if anyone else had additional market information or opinions regarding these market dynamics , let ' s discuss further at our next staff meeting . cs

Subject: news article on enron india : enron aftermath business line - 02 / 21 / 2000 abhay mehta copyright ( c ) 2000 kasturi source : world reporter ( tm ) - asia intelligence wire power play a study of the enron project * publishers : orient longman , new delhi * price : rs . 195 the enron power project at dabhol in ratnagiri district of maharashtra has been mired in nationwide controversy ever since the inception of the project proposal in 1992 ; and the sordid tale ends only in 1997 , with the supreme court of india refusing to even admit an appeal against the bombay high court decision , of december 1996 , which while commenting that " this case has highlighted to the people as to how even after 50 years of independence , political considerations outweigh the public interest and the interest of the state and to what extent the government can go to justify its actions not only before the public but even before the courts of law " - yet dismissed a public interest petition against the project on the ( purely technical ) ground of res judicata , even though new facts , new arguments , new evidence of the violation of the laws of the land had been advanced by the petitioners . the fact that the fresh violations of the law were not even considered and recorded , despite the petitioners adducing the required evidence , can only be termed as strange , perhaps bizarre . abhay mehta ' s simple , factual documentation - in fact a chronological narration - of all events , including the process of bending all rules , of subverting the law for promoting a project involving unparalleled future liabilities for maharashtra , indeed for the whole of india - is not only masterly , it is devastating . it is a short , pithy book which deserves to be read from cover to cover by all thinking citizens of this country . barring the concluding chapter , the epilogue , there are no personal comments , only facts , disseminated from the original papers , mostly ' secret ' documents . all documentation has been carefully , faithfully recorded , including extracts from supposedly ' top secret ' minutes of cabinet committee meetings ; and the specific violations of the law ( which were opposed by a few public spirited civil servants , much to their disadvantage ) have been pointed up . apart from an introductory ' primer on electricity ' - introduced for the benefit of the layman , explaining some technical issues relating to electricity generation , transmission and distribution - and the background of the events of 1991 , the foreign exchange crisis , and the aftermath of the crisis , the other fifteen chapters , three appendices and fourteen annexes of the small book ( of 226 pages ) packs in an enormous volume of factual information . the strange saga of the enron project , and the sheer magnitude of the future problems this one single project poses for the country , need to be briefly recounted here , for essentially , it is the coming generation which would have to face the problem . the mseb has contracted to buy - and if not used , to pay for - 2000 mw of electricity ( for a period of 20 years ) from the dabhol power company ( the legal entity set up by enron , as an unlimited liability company registered in india , through a maze of intricate crossholdings of equity by half a dozen or more ' front ' companies registered in various tax - free havens . abhay mehta has indicated the total payments to enron over 20 years amount to $ 35 billion ( at 1998 exchange rates , around rs . 1 , 25 , 000 crores ) over the life of the project . one must record that : ( a ) crude oil / oil product prices have as of writing , more than doubled since the above calculations were made . a per the ' doctored ' figures presented by the company ( and its advocate ) , the charge per unit of electricity supplied , at the 1998 level of prices , was to 4 . 39 cent ( per unit ) as ' capacity charge ' and 3 . 43 cents ( per unit ) for ' energy costs ' . the former is indexed to the us inflation rate , and the latter to international fuel prices . the former may be assumed to have gone up only marginally ( rounded to 4 . 4 cents per unit ) ; we know that fuel prices have more than doubled internationally over 1999 . assuming the ' fuel costs ' to have increased less than 100 per cent - even though international prices have more than doubled - we may assume ( for 1999 ) energy costs of 6 . 85 cents per units , making for a total payment of 11 . 25 us cents per unit of electricity supplied by the dabhol power company ( dpc ) to mseb in late 1999 , in phase i of the project . within another two years , at 2000 mw , the annual offtake ( for 365 days x 24 hours / day ) would be 17 . 52 billion kwh ; and at 11 . 25 cents per unit , the total payment amounts to $ 1 . 97 billion annually ; for 20 years , this workout to $ 39 . 4 billion . this is not counting any further inflation in either energy costs or capacity charge . at today ' s exchange rate - about rs . 43 . 5 per us dollar - in rupee terms this works out to wore than rs . 175 , 000 crores ( as compared to rs . 125 , 000 crores indicated by abhay mehta ) . this is the cost to mseb in rupee ; and to the country in foreign exchange as payment to just one project authority , for supply of part of the power required in maharashtra . the really significant point to note in this connection is that this payment - and considerably more , depending on ( a ) future increase in ' capacity charges ' depending on us inflation rate , and international prices of lngaphtha ( for ' fuel costs ' ) , and ( b ) depreciation of the exchange rate of the rupee vis - a - vis the us dollar - is obligatory ; the assets of the mseb , the maharashtra government indeed , all assets of the government of india ( present and future ) are mortgaged to enron , by way of sovereign guarantees extended by both governments . the other significant point in this connection is that - as predicted by all independent indian experts as well as the world bank - the enron project he forced the mseb to cut its offtake of tata electric company ' s and its own much cheaper thermal power already ; in a postscript dated august 1999 , abhay mehta has indicated that already , the mseb had stopped buying between 200 and 250 mw of power from tata electric ( available at rs . 1 . 80 per unit ) and has had to backdown its own chandrapur thermal power station ( cost of this power being rs . 1 . 20 per unit ) , while forced to buy more expensive enron power at rs . 5 per unit . the loss to mseb on this count alone comes to rs . 460 crore per year . this had in fact , been predicted earlier even by the world bank . it is pointless here to go into the details of how precisely all this was contrived , by a deliberate campaign of ' disinformation ' , of blatant lies , of sidelining of expert opinion , not only of independent experts but also the goi ' s own official advisers in this matter , namely , the central electricity authority as well as that of the world bank , which was resolutely opposed to this project . the detailed facts , the letters exchanged in the above context , the pressure tactics adopted , the flouting of all procedures norms , even statutory provisions of the electricity ( supply ) act , are all carefully documented by abhay mehta . mehta correctly concludes : " we frequently blame external agencies - like the world bank - for all our problems , when , as a matter of fact , we ourselves are our own worst enemies . in the instant case , the world bank not only advised the government of india against the project , it stood resolutely firm in its assessment of the total inadvisability of this project . in fact , one must note here that in 1996 , neighbouring pakistan , which had entered into a somewhat similar mou with enron , cancelled the project ( and the power purchase agreement with enron ) , for a $ 670 million , 782 mw residual oil - fuelled power plant , even though that agreement had stipulated enron power supply at a fixed rate of 6 . 4 us cents per kwh over a 30 year period . ( note the estimated rate of 11 . 25 cents per kwh for dabhol power for the mseb in december 1999 , which works out to around rs . 5 per unit ) . one could go on ; but one must leave the reader to go through abhay mehta ' s crisp , factual , matter of fact narration of the enron saga , and switch over to the point made by him in the epilogue to the story , about ' the next round of scams ' . for quite some time , the ruling elite in india has been intent on ' privatising ' all public enterprises ; and even ' utilities ' are no exception . the ' unbundling ' of infrastructure with a view to privatisation of all the ' profitable ' segments . all this - as per the current ' disinformation campaign ' - is supposedly in the interest of rationalisation and greater efficiency of poorer supply . the author has referred in this context to the acquisition from the government - by the torrent group - of the ahmedabad and surat electricity companies at less than one - tenth of the market value of the assets of thee facilities . again , much like the enron saga , all objections by the finance department of the gujarat government were overruled . and , abhay mehta has predicated that this onslaught - the break - up of power utilities into three segments , generation , transmission and distribution , - with a view to their privatisation is likely to be the new thrust by the ruling elite , for reasons that do not require to be spelt out . though mehta had the examples of the torrent group takeover of ahmedabad and surat electricity companies , and of the break up of the orissa state electricity board before him , yet his statement can be stated today to be prophetic ; the upseb is now on the firing line . the recent strike by the workers and engineers of the upseb in protest of the announced up government decision to trifurcate the upseb ; and the union minister of power , mr . rangarajan kumaramangalam ' s statement that the upseb is a loss making , inefficient unit and that privatisation of the facilities after the trifurcation - need to be noted . that 40 per cent of the dues of the upseb are from the up government ; that tariffs for up electricity supply are fixed by the up government and not by the upseb ; that the upseb does not have the cash even for routine maintenance as a result of the above - these are facts that nobody is prepared even to consider . that the remedy for upseb lies in a different kind of reform and restructuring , is not even to be debated . the whole idea is to privatise the profitable segments , and to leave the public sector entity with all the problem areas , including rural energy supply . it is against this background that abhay mehta ' s book needs to be widely disseminated , read , and its implications understood . what is at stake is not a ' utility ' here or a psu there . what is at stake is the future of some 80 per cent of the have - nots in this country . what is at stake is the ' pillory ' of the assets of the nation for private aggrandisement . arun ghosh

Subject: early news on the california situation breaking news : california stakeholders agree to key objectives posted 10 : 18 am ( cst ) jan 10 , 2001 signs of compromise and cooperation emerged from a marathon seven - hour meeting last night between california government officials , power industry executives and the clinton administration on california ' s continuing energy crisis . a set of key principles were hammered out by the two dozen participants , according to a statement issued following the meeting . the stakeholders agreed on the need for cooperation to " maintain stability and avoid bankruptcy of california utilities and assure the long - term regularity of market conditions . " the utilities have amassed $ 12 billion in unrecovered wholesale power costs , and despite the recent approval of new rate surcharges the utilities remain on the brink of financial insolvency . the meeting participants agreed on a few crucial elements of a solution to california ' s power woes , including the following : development of approaches to promote long - term purchases of power , possibly by the state , from generators at an " attractive fixed rate ; " the willingness of generators and qualifying facilities and marketers to provide on a short - term basis " forebearance of amounts owed by pacific gas the need to find " satisfactory approaches " to the utilities ' obligations to purchase power ; cooperation to " better match supply and demand ; " and review of the existing qualifying facilities payment structures . working groups are meeting today in washington , d . c . to address additional technical details and the senior policy makers will reconvene this weekend to complete an agreement . ferc chairman james hoecker , said it was " to early to declare victory , " but it was " an important first step to try to find ways to maintain stability and avoid bankruptcy . " hoecker , who also announced today that he will be leaving the federal energy regulatory commission on jan . 18 , said the atmosphere at the meeting was highly cooperative . " they appear to be headed in the direction that would seem to be consistent with ferc ' s dec . 15 order , " he said .

Subject: merger news articles a full list of news articles will be distributed on monday , but here is some of the initial coverage . business / financial desk ; section a rival to buy enron , top energy trader , after financial fall by alex berenson and andrew ross sorkin 11 / 10 / 2001 the new york times page 1 , column 2 c . 2001 new york times company with its stock plunging and its finances in doubt , the world ' s largest energy trader , the enron corporation , agreed to be acquired yesterday by the rival dynegy inc . for about $ 9 billion in stock and the assumption of $ 13 billion in debt . the deal is an extraordinary turnabout for enron , a houston - based company that had been a driving force behind electricity deregulation nationwide . its chairman , kenneth l . lay , a big contributor to the republican party , provided political influence , while its former chief executive , jeffrey k . skilling , helped create markets for the trading of electricity and natural gas . but last winter , when california ' s effort to deregulate the electricity market led to soaring power prices and rolling blackouts , enron was the subject of much criticism and political anger . recent disclosures of discrepancies in enron ' s financial statements and an investigation by the securities and exchange commission caused the shares to plunge this week to their lowest level in a decade . as other companies became wary of doing business with it , enron - - also facing a potential cash squeeze - - apparently had little choice but to find a buyer , and a deal was hastily cobbled together this week . for critics who had complained about enron ' s market power and its dominance , the combination poses additional concerns . dynegy ' s acquisition of enron will be reviewed by state and federal agencies , led by the justice department and the federal energy regulatory commission . analysts said today that they expected scrutiny of the combined companies ' holdings in california , where dynegy owns power - generating plants and enron accounts for much of the trading of natural gas - - fuel for the state ' s electric power plants . buying enron at a deep discount - - it has lost $ 60 billion in market value this year - - could make dynegy the dominant trader of electricity and natural gas . but the agreement carries big risks as well . along with enron ' s gas pipelines and high - technology trading floor , dynegy will take on enron ' s substantial debt and a web of complex transactions that enron has spun over the last decade . in addition to the $ 13 billion in debt that enron carries on its books , it has guaranteed at least $ 4 billion in off - balance sheet loans , and the hidden debt could total as much as $ 10 billion , said carol coale , a stock analyst with prudential securities . charles l . watson , dynegy ' s chairman and chief executive , said yesterday that dynegy could sort through enron ' s tangled finances . ' ' we know the company well , ' ' mr . watson said . ' ' it ' s not like we just started fresh . i ' m confident that it ' s as solid as we thought it was . ' ' the new company will combine enron ' s 25 , 000 - mile natural gas pipeline system with the large number of power plants that dynegy owns worldwide , as well as illinois power , a dynegy subsidiary that serves 650 , 000 customers in illinois . but its most important asset will be its trading desk . it will be the largest energy trader in the nation , trading more than twice as much power and natural gas as its closest competitors . mr . watson said the company did not expect to sell significant properties and that the deal should pass regulatory scrutiny . ' ' there ' s really not a lot of overlap in assets , ' ' he said . mr . watson and steve bergstrom , dynegy ' s president , will hold those positions in the new company , which will be called dynegy and remain in houston . mr . lay , who created enron in the mid - 1980 ' s , will not have any role in the combined company ' s daily operations . he has been asked to join its board but has not provided an answer . ' ' the last three weeks haven ' t been a lot of fun , ' ' he said . in a statement announcing the agreement yesterday afternoon , mr . watson said he was confident that the merger would produce a strong new company . ' ' enron is the ideal strategic partner for dynegy , ' ' mr . watson said . ' ' we will keep a strong balance sheet and straightforward financial structure as key priorities . ' ' to shore up enron ' s finances , dynegy will immediately put $ 1 . 5 billion into enron through chevrontexaco , the giant oil company , which already owns 27 percent of dynegy . another billion dollars will be injected once the deal is completed . investors appeared comfortable yesterday that dynegy could make the deal work . after falling $ 3 , to $ 33 , on wednesday , when the companies first said they were in discussions , dynegy rose $ 5 . 76 on thursday and yesterday to close the week at $ 38 . 76 . ' ' on paper , it works , ' ' ms . coale of prudential said . ' ' the combined company would be the leading trader , the market leader in most of their businesses . ' ' ms . coale , who has a sell rating on enron and a buy rating on dynegy , said she planned to keep her buy rating on dynegy . as it works to have the deal approved , dynegy will have to persuade enron ' s traders to stay with the combined company . the pain of the stock ' s 90 percent plunge this year will not be equally shared . some enron employees have held onto their shares and seen their retirement accounts eviscerated . meanwhile , mr . lay , mr . skilling and other former and current executives sold hundreds of millions of dollars in enron stock in 2000 and this year . the companies also have very different corporate cultures . dynegy emphasizes teamwork , while enron is more competitive , said ehud ronn , director of the center for energy finance education and research at the university of texas . even before the merger was announced , enron had lost some of its employees to other energy trading companies , mr . ronn said . some investors and analysts say that the problems with enron ' s finances may extend beyond the partnerships that have been the subject of wall street ' s scrutiny the last month . james chanos , a short - seller who has been one of enron ' s most vocal critics , said there was increasing evidence that enron ' s energy trading operations were not as profitable as the company had said . ' ' there appears to be a culture at enron of aggressively booking profits and deferring or obscuring losses , ' ' mr . chanos said . on thursday , enron said in a filing with the s . e . c that it had overstated its earnings by almost $ 600 million over the last five years . mr . chanos said more restatements were possible , noting that the filing disclosed partnerships had been used to hedge almost $ 1 billion in losses in 2000 and this year . so far , the losses from those partnerships remain off enron ' s financial statements , mr . chanos said . enron ' s stock had been under pressure for most of this year , as the company ran up large losses with failed efforts to expand outside its core trading operation . in august , mr . skilling resigned as chief executive , and mr . lay resumed control of daily operations . still , the company appeared financially sound until last month , when it disclosed that its shareholders ' equity , a measure of the company ' s value , dropped by $ 1 . 2 billion because of deals disclosed only hazily in its financial statements . the announcement unnerved investors , who wondered whether enron had found ways to inflate its profits and move debt off its balance sheet , and led the s . e . c . to begin an investigation . mr . lay tried to reassure investors that enron ' s finances were in order and that its businesses remained strong . but the last three weeks have brought a series of damaging revelations about partnerships that enron formed with some of its top executives , including its former chief financial officer , andrew s . fastow . with questions mounting , the major credit - rating agencies began to downgrade enron ' s debt , putting additional pressure on the company . if enron ' s debt rating falls below investment grade , it would be forced to repay $ 3 . 3 billion in loans that it had guaranteed . to strengthen its balance sheet and bolster its stock , enron turned to big investors like warren e . buffett in search of billions of dollars of financing . when the financing did not quickly appear , its stock fell further . by this week , some major energy traders were refusing to extend credit to enron , worrying that the company would be unable to make good on its contracts . the mirant corporation , an atlanta - based power plant owner and electricity trader , sharply curtailed its trading with enron this week . ' ' we ' re trading with them on a very limited basis , ' ' said james peters , a mirant spokesman . ' ' it ' s not business as usual .

' ' now , wall street ' s dissatisfaction with enron ' s secretive ways has delivered the company into the arms of its much smaller houston rival , dynegy inc . , in a deal worth about $ 9 billion in stock and the assumption of $ 13 billion in debt . the combination of the two companies , energy experts and lawmakers said today , poses a novel set of challenges for regulators still struggling to grasp the complexities of the marketplace that enron invented . ' ' we ' re in a supersonic - speed era of electronic trading with a horse - and - buggy - era regulatory system to protect consumers , ' ' said representative edward j . markey , a massachusetts democrat who has devised legislation to close the regulatory gap . dynegy ' s acquisition of enron is expected to be reviewed by numerous state and federal agencies , led by the justice department , the federal trade commission and the federal energy regulatory commission . analysts said today that sharp scrutiny would be given to the combined companies ' holdings in california , where dynegy owns generating plants and enron controls a large part of the market for trading natural gas - - the fuel for a big share of the state ' s electric power plants . ' ' dynegy would now have a greater ability to take the dominant position in gas and raise the price of electricity , ' ' said frank wolak , a professor of economics at stanford university . mr . wolak , a consultant to the justice department on a 1999 antitrust case that led to limits on another merger of electricity and natural gas companies in southern california , said he was skeptical that regulators were up to the task of reviewing today ' s deal . the transaction ' ' is something the department of justice needs to look at , and they are going to have a hard time looking at , ' ' mr . wolak said . ' ' and it ' s beyond the ability of the f . e . r . c . to look at . ' ' pat wood - - named chairman of the federal energy commission earlier this year with the backing of kenneth l . lay , the chairman of enron - - acknowledged in an interview today that the agency had ' ' a long way to go ' ' in matching the sophistication of the companies it regulates . but he said that the commission had made great strides in grappling with the new risk management techniques pioneered by enron , dynegy and other energy companies . it is hiring more experts , he said , adopting more restrictive rules on how much ' ' market power ' ' one party can control and requiring more disclosure of certain energy transactions . in an interview this evening , charles l . watson , the chairman of dynegy , said he did not believe that regulators reviewing the deal with enron would require the sale of any assets . ' ' we haven ' t really identified any pitfalls that require any sort of asset divestiture , ' ' he said . ' ' there ' s not really any overlap . ' ' a senior executive at one of enron ' s largest energy - trading rivals disagreed . ' ' i don ' t think this deal gets through unscathed , ' ' he said today . ' ' i ' m sure the justice department and the f . t . c . will look closely at the pretty substantial concentration of market power these companies will have in the energy - trading area . ' ' enron is mainly a trader of natural gas and electricity - - indeed , the biggest player in both those markets - - and it also owns a network of gas pipelines . dynegy processes and sells natural gas and generates and sells electricity . each company owns a local electric utility , too : dynegy owns illinois power in decatur , ill . , while enron owns portland general electric in portland , ore . , but last month announced plans to sell it to another oregon utility . for a decade , as it transformed itself from a gas pipeline operator into the nation ' s biggest energy trader , enron enjoyed unalloyed lobbying success in washington and the enthusiastic backing of wall street . in the early months of the bush administration , mr . lay - - whose company was one of the biggest financial backers of george w . bush ' s presidential campaign - - played a prominent , and some said unusual , role in helping the white house pick nominees to the federal energy commission . enron executives met with vice president dick cheney , whose energy task force backed many of the deregulatory initiatives pushed by mr . lay . now , ' ' the company has become a pariah , ' ' an enron executive said today . ' ' the bush administration doesn ' t want to have anything to do with us . ' ' the problems began with the energy crisis in california , where enron ' s outspoken defense of deregulation , even more than its electricity trading activities , made the company a favorite whipping boy of politicians and consumer advocates . in the financial markets , meanwhile , enron ' s confusing disclosures , tolerated when its stock was soaring , drew disdain as the calming of the energy storms in california and other parts of the country beat the shares down , starting last spring . ' ' enron fell victim to their own inconsistencies on transparency , ' ' mr . wolak said . as california officials sought to understand why energy prices had soared out of control , he said , enron ' s ' ' view was that we want everybody ' s data , but if you want ours , get a subpoena . ' ' energy executives and regulators said that sort of arrogance had long marked enron ' s attitude about government oversight . electricity sales had for decades been the job of local utility companies , operating as monopolies and selling power at regulated rates within their service areas . a few entrepreneurs , led by mr . lay , conceived a different model in which power could be sold by generators or middlemen to big corporate users or utilities in faraway regions , at whatever price the market would bear . in the early 1990 ' s , congress - - under heavy lobbying by enron - - passed legislation that began to open up electricity sales to marketers . before long , enron became one of the first companies to receive government approval to sell electricity at market rates . the market for interstate sales of natural gas had been freed up a few years earlier , and critics complained that traders like enron were gleaning their profits by stoking volatility in gas prices . in the mid - 1990 ' s , independent gas producers backed legislation in congress to allow the creation of a co - operative marketing organization , which , they hoped , would have helped stabilize prices . raymond plank , the chairman of the apache corporation , a gas producer based in houston , said that the big gas marketing and trading companies , including enron , successfully lobbied to kill the plan , leaving prices as volatile as ever . ' ' it was a great concept , ' ' mr . plank said . ' ' we could have headed off the problems we have today . ' ' enron ' s final lobbying success came last year . with a strong push from the company ' s lobbyists , congress passed futures trading legislation that exempted internet energy trading platforms like enrononline , the industry leader , from oversight by the commodity futures trading commission . enron takes the other side of trades on its exchange . in traditional markets like the new york mercantile exchange , which remain subject to oversight , the exchange acts as a middleman between buyers and sellers . under mr . watson , dynegy has been less of a pathbreaker than enron , and though california politicians denounced it , too , as a profiteer during the energy crisis , most analysts say it has been less aggressive than enron in both its business practices and its lobbying . indeed , the rival energy - trading executive today predicted ' ' a huge culture clash ' ' as the houston neighbors merge . ' ' blood will flow in houston over the integration of the trading operation , ' ' he said . but regulators may find dynegy easier to deal with . earlier this year , the federal energy commission asked for comments on whether it should tighten scrutiny of dealings between natural gas pipelines and energy - trading shops owned by the same company . enron wondered what all the bother was . ' ' would stricter rules prevent real affiliate abuse that current rules do not , ' ' it wrote in a regulatory filing , ' ' or would they instead merely restrict the activities of some of the more successful participants in the marketplace ? ' ' dynegy , by contrast , painted a grim picture and invited regulators to crack down . ' ' abuses abound , ' ' it said , ' ' because of financial windfalls , difficulty of detection , lengthy investigations and increased complexity of the market .

" this is basically a rogue corporation , " said sen . steve peace ( d - el cajon ) , an outspoken critic of enron for years who dealt with the company as he chaired the committee that hammered out the legislative portion of california ' s landmark electricity deregulation plan in 1996 . " it has from the beginning been a rogue corporation which answered in its mind to a higher law - - a fundamental belief that there are laws of economics that supersede the law of the land . " a failed experiment steve maviglio , spokesman for gov . gray davis , said that although enron was never a major force in california ' s doomed electricity market , it was outspoken in support of deregulation . " in a sense , their experiment was much like california ' s experiment - - a failure , " he said . said harvey rosenfield , president of the foundation for taxpayer and consumer rights in santa monica : " nothing could better illustrate the disaster of deregulation than the fact that one of its biggest proponents , which reaped the reward of deregulation , is suffering the consequences . " enron is the world ' s largest energy trader , handling one of four energy deals in the united states through its online trading operation , enrononline . since it reported a surprising third - quarter loss on oct . 16 , partly tied to shadowy investment vehicles , enron has endured a huge loss of investor confidence , which brought on a massive cash crunch and some shrinkage of its trading business . under the deal announced friday , dynegy , invited in two weeks ago after enron fell short in its efforts to line up new financing , would immediately help enron by pouring $ 1 . 5 billion in cash into the company . the money would be provided by chevrontexaco corp . , the san francisco oil company that owns nearly 27 % of dynegy . enron shareholders would get 0 . 2685 dynegy share for each enron share , which values the company at about $ 7 . 7 billion based on friday ' s stock close . dynegy shares surged $ 2 . 26 to close at $ 38 . 76 per share on the new york stock exchange ; enron added 22 cents to close at $ 8 . 63 per share , still off 89 % year to date . if the deal closes in six to nine months , as the parties expect , dynegy and chevrontexaco would invest $ 1 billion additionally in the combined company . " this is just a financial bonanza really for both companies , " said charles l . watson , dynegy chairman and chief executive , who will head the combined company . watson said the merger would immediately add to dynegy ' s earnings . even so , the repercussions of enron ' s fall from grace could be far - reaching . coming on the heels of california ' s energy crisis , enron ' s troubles may slow the country ' s march toward energy deregulation , which lay and enron championed for years as a potential boon to consumers and the economy in general . but the deal announced friday will prevent an even worse outcome , energy experts said : the threatened collapse of enron , which would clog up for a time the business of buying and selling electricity , natural gas and oil . that could interfere with delivery of energy around the country , they said . " this is an encouraging development for the energy industry , " said stephen baum , chairman of sempra energy , the san diego - based parent of southern california gas and san diego gas ; photographer : associated press ; photo : " this is just a financial bonanza really for both companies , " says charles l . watson , dynegy chairman and chief executive . ; ; photographer : associated press dynegy to buy enron associated press 11 / 10 / 2001 deseret news do 7 copyright ( c ) 2001 deseret news publishing co . houston - - energy marketer dynegy inc . announced friday that it will buy its much larger rival , the once mighty but now troubled enron corp . , for $ 8 billion in stock . dynegy also will assume a hefty $ 15 billion in enron debt . the announcement came after enron ' s stock price plummeted about 80 percent over the past three weeks because of concerns that the company wasn ' t revealing serious financial problems to shareholders . under the deal , chevrontexaco corp . , which owns more than a quarter of dynegy , would quickly provide about $ 1 . 5 billion . chevrontexaco also would contribute an additional $ 1 billion upon completion of the deal , the companies said . " with its market - making capabilities , earnings power and proven strategic approach to wholesale markets , enron is the ideal strategic partner for dynegy , " dynegy chairman and chief executive officer chuck watson said in announcing the purchase . watson made it clear that he would not tolerate the sort of financial practices that prompted explosive disclosures by enron this week - - including an admission that more than half a billion dollars in debt had been kept off the company ' s books . " as a combined company , we will focus on leveraging our core skill sets and , as always , we will keep a strong balance sheet and straightforward financial structure as key priorities , " watson said . enron is the country ' s top buyer and seller of natural gas , and the no . 1 wholesale power marketer . the company operates a 25 , 000 - mile gas pipeline system , and also markets and trades metals , paper , coal , chemicals and fiber - optic bandwidth . dynegy controls nearly 15 , 000 megawatts of power generating capacity through investments in power projects , and sells the energy in wholesale markets and through utilities . at a news conference , watson said company officials who negotiated the deal came away convinced that enron was worth buying despite its recent troubles . " we looked under the hood . . . it ' s just as strong as it ever was , " watson said . under the terms of the deal , enron shareholders will receive . 2685 dynegy share for each share of enron common stock , valuing each enron share at $ 10 . 41 . enron has about 775 million common shares , said spokeswoman karen denne . that represents a 21 percent premium above enron ' s closing price of $ 8 . 63 friday on the new york stock exchange - - but still just a fraction of their 52 - week high of $ 84 . 87 . dynegy ' s shares climbed $ 2 . 26 , or 6 percent , to close at $ 38 . 76 on the nyse . in after hours trading on the nyse , enron shares shot up 15 . 6 percent , or $ 1 . 35 , to $ 9 . 98 . dynegy shares were unchanged . dynegy ' s stockholders will own approximately 64 percent of the new company , with enron ' s stockholders holding the remainder . the boards of both companies have unanimously approved the transaction , which is expected to close next summer . the deal is expected to save the combined company between $ 400 million and $ 500 million annually because of continued elimination of " non - core " enron holdings and lower operating costs . watson will remain as chairman and chief executive of the combined company , which will retain the dynegy inc . name . steve bergstrom will remain as president of dynegy . enron chairman and chief executive kenneth l . lay will no longer have a role in day - to - day management of the company , but has been offered a seat on the combined company ' s board and will help shepherd the merger through . " i am personally committed to working with chuck watson , steve bergstrom and their colleagues in the months ahead to accomplish the merger and to build a solid foundation for future value creation , " lay said . dynegy said that greg whalley , the current president and chief operating officer of enron , will become an executive vice president of the new dynegy . he said the merger sets the best course for enron . " few of the options we considered for our core business going forward provided us with the earning potential and immediate synergies that a merger with dynegy could deliver , " whalley said . " together with enron ' s recently announced bank commitments , this cash infusion gives enron immediate liquidity , which we believe will enable the company to maintain its investment grade credit rating . " the merger was announced a day after enron acknowledged it overstated earnings by about 20 percent over the past four years and kept large amounts of debt off its balance sheets through business partnerships now under investigation by the securities and exchange commission . analysts said the merger rescues enron , but leaves dynegy in uncharted territory - - with the outcome of the sec investigation completely unknown .

" i don ' t think anybody can absolutely unequivocally say there ' s nothing [ more ] there , " he said . dynegy ' s stock price closed higher friday , rising $ 2 . 26 , or 6 . 2 percent , to $ 38 . 76 . enron ' s stock was up 22 cents , or 2 . 6 percent , at $ 8 . 63 a share . through the third quarter of 2001 , the companies together have natural gas sales of about 40 billion cubic feet per day and power sales exceeding 500 million megawatt hours . in addition , the new dynegy ' s delivery network would include more than 22 , 000 megawatts of generating capacity and 25 , 000 miles of interstate pipelines . in enron , dynegy is taking on a company saddled with a heavy debt load , a credit rating that has been downgraded to near junk bond status and which is under the cloud of a securities and exchange commission investigation . big premium under the stock - for - stock - swap portion of the deal , valued at $ 8 . 846 billion , dynegy is paying the equivalent of $ 10 . 41 a share for the 850 million outstanding enron shares , a 24 percent premium . dynegy would pay . 2685 shares of its stock for each share of enron . in addition , dynegy agreed to provide a $ 1 . 5 billion cash infusion to help stabilize its larger competitor and to assume an estimated $ 15 billion in debt . on thursday enron reported that its debt was an estimated $ 12 . 9 billion pending completion of financial statements dated sept . 30 . a day later the company ' s accounting of its debt jumped $ 2 billion . dynegy ' s current shareholders , including chevron texaco corp . , will end up owning 64 percent of the new company . chevron texaco said it would invest an additional $ 2 . 5 billion in dynegy . enron ' s stockholders would own about 36 percent of the combined company ' s stock at closing , which is anticipated in the third quarter of 2002 . chicago - area operations in illinois , in addition to illinois power , dynegy owns a chicago - area electricity peaker plant and is a partner with nicor inc . in nicor energy , an unregulated natural gas utility in the chicago market . enron ' s subsidiary , enron energy services , has a high - profile contract to provide 60 percent of chicago ' s city government ' s electricity . it also has contracts to provide power to quaker oats co . and the university of chicago , among others . in addition to watson , other top dynegy management would remain in place in the new company . president steve bergstrom and rob doty , chief financial officer , would retain those positions in the combined company . enron ' s president and chief operating officer , greg whalley , would become an executive vice president . the board of directors of the combined company would have 14 members . dynegy ' s 11 designees would include three from chevrontexaco . enron would have the right to designate a minimum of three board members . financial enron accepts $ 8 billion buyout offer from dynegy ; energy giant was forced to negotiating table after disclosing that it had overstated earnings peter behr washington post staff writer 11 / 10 / 2001 the washington post final eol copyright 2001 , the washington post co . all rights reserved embattled enron corp . yesterday accepted a buyout offer valued at about $ 8 billion from crosstown rival dynegy inc . if the deal is completed , it would end houston - based enron ' s reign as the leader in the huge energy trading markets that set the prices of power and natural gas in the nation . its cash dwindling and its credit rating hammered , enron was forced to the negotiating table after its recent disclosures that its obligations to a complex web of partnerships involving company officials had caused the trading powerhouse to overstate its earnings and obscure its total debt obligations . four top enron officials have resigned or been replaced since july and , once dynegy takes control , enron ' s chairman and chief executive , kenneth lay , will also leave the company . lay said yesterday that he had not decided whether to accept dynegy ' s offer to serve on the combined company ' s board . " it ' s been a good ride for a long time , " lay said in a conference call last night . " the last three weeks haven ' t been a whole lot of fun . " the final deal was announced after the close of stock trading . enron ' s shares - - which had fallen from $ 33 to $ 8 after the disclosures - - ended the day slightly higher , at $ 8 . 63 . dynegy ' s stock closed at $ 38 . 76 , up $ 2 . 26 . dynegy offered all stock for the enron shares , so the total value of the deal will fluctuate with dynegy ' s stock price . dynegy also said it would assume about $ 13 billion in enron debt , bringing the total value of the transaction to around $ 21 billion . dynegy ' s rescue of enron will begin with an immediate cash infusion of $ 1 . 5 billion , which will be supplied by chevrontexaco corp . , a major dynegy stockholder . chevrontexaco will invest another $ 1 billion in dynegy after the acquisition has passed regulatory review and is completed , which executives said they expect will take six to nine months as enron tries to unscramble the complex partnerships that are now under investigation by the securities and exchange commission . the takeover agreement gives dynegy an escape clause permitting it to cancel the purchase if enron winds up with heavy regulatory fines or legal judgments from shareholder suits tied to its handling of the partnerships . chuck watson , dynegy ' s chairman and chief executive , said in the conference call that a close scrutiny over the past two weeks of enron ' s financial condition convinced him that the company ' s trading and pipeline businesses were solid . " we looked under the hood , and guess what ? it looked just as strong as we thought it was . " watson said he did not think more damaging disclosures were forthcoming from enron . until the partnership mess , enron was the nation ' s dominant energy trader , and it had front - door political connections to the white house . lay , its longtime chairman , raised more then $ 100 , 000 for the presidential election campaign of his friend george w . bush . enron rode the growth of energy trading markets beginning in the mid - 1990 s , as first natural gas , and then electric power sales were deregulated at the wholesale level . its revenues leaped from $ 9 . 2 billion in 1995 to $ 100 . 8 billion last year . during those heady times , the houston company could choose which questions to answer about its dealings with related partnerships and its byzantine bookkeeping . " it was always very difficult to get information , " said louis b . gagliardi , an analyst with john s . herold inc . " they would always rebuff you . " until this fall , the muscular company seemed too big to stumble , said investment manager david coxe , with harris insight equity fund in chicago . coxe bought 78 , 000 shares of enron at $ 40 a share in august , after wrestling with the decision for months , he said . then jeffrey skilling , enron ' s chief executive and strategic mastermind , unexpectedly resigned . the stock , which had been as high as $ 90 in august 2000 , pitched downward . " enron seemed so indispensable to the nation ' s energy markets that i thought it inconceivable it could implode , " coxe said . " that ' s how i got sucked in . " enron ' s fall is " classic hubris , " coxe said : a greek tragedy striking someone who chose to defy the gods - - " in this case , the rules of the system . " among the rules that enron now acknowledges it didn ' t follow were the accounting standards that applied to the complex partnerships it created . the purpose of the partnerships , enron said , was to reduce the risks of investments in internet transmission systems and to sell power plants and other assets it no longer wanted . the accounting errors were described in a 20 - page sec filing enron made thursday . the errors resulted in a $ 1 . 2 billion reduction in the value of shareholders ' equity . the company also said it had overstated its earnings by $ 586 million since 1997 . enron created partnerships that would buy major assets - - such as a power plant - - that enron wanted to sell , or in other cases , assets such as fiber - optic cable networks that enron intended to run but did not want to have on its balance sheet . the partnerships had outside investors , but the general partner of two of them was enron ' s own chief financial officer , andrew fastow . he earned $ 30 million in fees from managing two of the largest partnerships , according to the sec document . enron added to the capital of these partnerships by pledging its stock , or securities convertible into stock . some of those stock transactions should have been counted as loans , resulting in the $ 1 . 2 billion drop in shareholder equity , enron now says . investors are asking why enron ' s auditor , arthur andersen llp , did not insist that these transactions be handled that way in the first place . enron ' s sec filing mentions but does not explain some " proposed audit adjustments " over the past four years that were overruled . even though , as enron now acknowledges , it created an information barrier , masking critical information and violating standard accounting rules , many financial analysts who were recommending the stock to investors were not pushing hard enough to punch through that barrier , some analysts acknowledge . " it was so complicated that everybody was afraid to raise their hands and say , ' i don ' t understand it , ' " gagliardi said . the questions are now coming , from a new committee reporting to enron ' s board that will investigate how the company ' s financial reporting was handled ; from the sec ; and , eventually , from teams of lawyers representing aggrieved shareholders . lay indicated yesterday he had not been aware until recently that enron employees other than fastow had profited from the partnership activity . enron directors had approved fastow ' s management of the partnerships , but fastow quit the partnerships in july and was then replaced as chief financial officer . enron this week fired treasurer ben glisan and kristina mourdant , an enron division lawyer , who it said had invested in partnerships that were tied to one of the major partnerships headed by fastow . the enron report to the sec describes a central role in these transactions played by michael j . kopper , an associate of fastow who left enron in july to take over fastow ' s financial interests in the partnership , the company said . enron will hold a conference call next week to discuss what it has uncovered about outside partnership investments . http : / / www . washingtonpost . com financial desk the nation news analysis a visionary fallen from grace james flanigan times staff writer 11 / 10 / 2001 los angeles times home edition a - 22 copyright 2001 / the times mirror company a year ago , enron corp . chairman kenneth l . lay was on top of the energy world . as a leading fund - raiser , contributor and energy advisor to the bush administration , he played a key role in shaping the new president ' s energy policy . as head of the world ' s largest energy trading company , he had an enormous influence on the price of energy in california and across the nation . enron ' s highflying stock helped him cash out $ 123 million in stock options last year alone . on friday , with enron being saved from financial collapse by agreeing to be acquired by rival dynegy inc . , lay ' s career and reputation are in shambles . under the merger , he will be stripped of a management job . his integrity is tattered , with enron ' s controversial financial dealings under federal investigation . enron investors and employees are chagrined and outraged because the company ' s stock lost 80 % of its value in recent weeks . the rapid rise and fall of lay , 58 , is a story of how a brilliant man with innovative ideas and a grand scheme to transform the world ' s energy markets was overcome with arrogance , associates and critics say . under lay , enron stretched the limits of the law and took risks that nearly caused its financial collapse , they say . that in turn could have resulted in a widespread disruption in energy supplies . " enron ' s behavior casts doubt on the integrity of our financial markets . it is a very serious matter , " said edward r . muller , an energy investor and former president of edison international ' s mission energy subsidiary . " nobody denies he ' s smart , but it ' s a question of integrity , " said raymond plank , chief executive of apache corp . and an associate of lay ' s in houston ' s vibrant oil and gas industry . lay and longtime partner jeffrey k . skilling , who served briefly as enron ' s chief executive before resigning abruptly in august , rose to prominence in the last decade through the use of innovative financial techniques designed to exploit a reduction in government regulation of energy . lay transformed world energy industries through his vision of new , market - driven ways to finance natural gas and electricity production and transmission . the financial markets that lay and his enron associates created had an enormous effect on california ' s disastrous experiment in electricity deregulation . critics say his influence was excessive and misguided . " ken lay was a mystic , " said state sen . steve peace ( d - el cajon ) , an outspoken critic of enron . " whatever he said had to make sense because he was ken lay . it was hero worship . many of the people working as economists at the federal energy regulatory commission worshiped ken lay . as a consequence , the things enron promoted and pushed for were never challenged , intellectually and otherwise . " lay , who has a doctorate in economics , had modest beginnings as the son of a poor country preacher who did farm labor on the side to raise money for his children ' s education . in the navy in the late 1960 s , lay was assigned to the defense department because of his economic acumen . " he allocated pentagon dollars more efficiently in purchasing for the military , " said mark palmer , chief spokesman for enron . lay worked for exxon and other energy firms in the 1970 s , amid soaring oil prices , gasoline shortages and still - regulated natural gas . he headed houston natural gas , a predecessor firm of enron , in the 1980 s as falling prices for oil and natural gas presented grave problems for houston ' s energy industries . when the federal government allowed pipelines to carry the gas of any producer , lay turned enron into a foremost firm in the new , deregulated industry . still , enron almost went bankrupt in the late 1980 s , with natural gas in oversupply and prices falling . it was then that skilling , a mckinsey ; photographer : reuters business struggling enron agrees to takeover by smaller rival dynegy one - time energy giant and southern co . often scrapped over access to markets matthew c . quinn staff 11 / 10 / 2001 the atlanta journal - constitution home f . 1 ( copyright , the atlanta journal and constitution - 2001 ) energy giant enron corp . capitulated to a mounting financial crisis friday and agreed to be taken over by a smaller competitor . but atlanta - based southern co . was not gloating at the misfortunes of its vanquished rival . it wasn ' t easy . for years , the two companies were locked in a struggle over access to electricity markets . enron pushed for competition and deregulation , while southern resisted to protect its dominance in the fast - growing southeast . sometimes the battle got nasty . " if thomas alva edison came back from the dead and called southern co . to get some electricity , he ' d find that nothing has changed , " jeffrey skilling , then enron ' s president , said in november 1997 . " these guys are living in an industry that was created 100 years ago , and they want to keep it that way . " fast forward four years . southern co . has split itself in two , retaining its regulated southeastern utility business and spinning off its own unregulated power generation and energy trading arm , mirant corp . southern reported net income of $ 1 billion for the first nine months of this year , and mirant ' s profits were $ 538 million . southern ' s shares are up 19 percent this year . mirant ' s have declined 7 percent . enron , on the other hand , lost 90 percent of its stock market value this year alone and this past week restated earnings for the past 4 1 / 2 years , reducing profit by more than $ 500 million . skilling was named chief executive in february but abruptly resigned after six months . this week he was subpoenaed to testify in a securities and exchange commission probe of the texas company ' s questionable relationships with outside partnerships . houston - based dynegy corp . , a crosstown rival , said late friday it will buy enron - - - once valued at $ 69 billion - - - for $ 7 . 8 billion in stock . enron will be wrapped into a " new dynegy " managed by top dynegy executives . that suggested even the name enron - - - synonymous with innovation in recent years in the utility industry - - - will go by the wayside . southern spokesman todd terrell declined to comment earlier in the day on enron ' s problems . a . w . " bill ' dahlberg , who retired as southern ' s chief executive in april and is now mirant ' s board chairman , said he regretted enron ' s troubles . " they were a rival and got credit for doing a lot of innovative things in our industry , " dahlberg said . " you always like to win the competition because you do well , not because somebody else does badly . " enron was a pioneer in the wholesale trading of electricity and natural gas , and has been widely imitated , from mirant ' s sprawling energy trading floor at perimeter center to an energy management subsidiary launched this year by agl resources , parent of atlanta gas light co . as the largest u . s . energy trading firm , enron ' s tentacles run deep . it was active at the public service commission in 1998 when rules for georgia ' s natural gas deregulation were written , only to opt out of becoming a gas marketer itself . but new power co . , which is 45 percent owned by enron , became georgia ' s newest marketer this year . a dynegy - enron combination will create a $ 200 billion - a - year enterprise that will dwarf mirant in both the electricity and natural gas sectors . dynegy and mirant are considered more stable than was enron because they rely more on their own power plants for electricity and less on trading for power produced by others . and dynegy is no stranger to georgia . it is a minority partner with agl resources in georgia natural gas services , the state ' s no . 1 gas marketer . but the partners have been at odds for months . agl sued dynegy in july , alleging it " earned millions of dollars at the expense " of the marketing company that it supplies with natural gas . dynegy ' s counterclaim accused agl , among other things , of scheming to shift the partnership ' s gas supply deal to agl ' s own subsidiary , houston - based sequent energy management . dynegy in may started up a 500 megawatt natural gas - fired power plant in heard county despite opposition from nearby residents . dynegy is also a major buyer of electricity produced at southern co . ' s new power plant in jackson county .

" dynegy is taking out a competitor , acquiring some attractive assets , and they ' re doing it at an incredible price , " said joseph correnti , an analyst at wayne hummer investments . the two houston - based companies began negotiations a week ago as it became apparent enron needed cash to stay in business . dynegy , which is 26 - percent owned by chevrontexaco corp . , agreed to the deal after moody ' s investors service maintained an investment - grade rating on enron , eliminating a stumbling block in negotiations . the combined company will have annual revenue of more than $ 200 billion , ranking it as one of the nation ' s 10 largest . it will have more than 22 , 000 megawatts of electric generating capacity and 25 , 000 miles of natural gas pipeline . on thursday , enron acknowledged it overstated earnings by about 20 percent over the past four years and kept large amounts of debt off its balance sheet through business partnerships now under investigation by the securities and exchange commission . enron said financial statements from 1997 through the first half of 2001 " should not be relied upon . " revised statements reduced enron ' s profits for those years by $ 586 million and increased its debt by $ 628 million . during its recent turmoil , enron fired chief financial officer andrew fastow , who ran some of the partnerships under investigation by the sec . dynegy chief executive charles watson will head the combined company . the terms of the deal value each enron share at $ 10 . 41 , based on friday ' s closing stock prices . that represents a 21 - percent premium above enron ' s closing price of $ 8 . 63 . dynegy ' s shares closed at $ 38 . 76 , up 6 percent . it was not immediately clear what role enron chairman and chief executive kenneth l . lay would have in the new company . while watson has led a diversified company that put as much emphasis on building power plants as on energy trading , lay focused on the wholesale trading of natural gas and electricity . he had expanded enron in the 1980 s from a natural gas pipeline into the most formidable competitor in the business of energy trading , which was created by deregulation of energy markets in the united states and europe . dynegy announces $ 8 billion deal to buy larger rival enron by juan a . lozano associated press writer 11 / 09 / 2001 associated press newswires copyright 2001 . the associated press . all rights reserved . houston ( ap ) - energy marketer dynegy inc . announced friday that it will buy its much larger rival , the once mighty but now troubled enron corp . , for $ 8 billion in stock . dynegy also will assume a hefty $ 15 billion in enron debt . the announcement came after enron ' s stock price plummeted about 80 percent over the past three weeks because of concerns that the company wasn ' t revealing serious financial problems to shareholders . under the deal , chevrontexaco corp . , which owns more than a quarter of dynegy , would quickly provide about $ 1 . 5 billion . chevrontexaco also would contribute an additional $ 1 billion upon completion of the deal , the companies said . " with its market - making capabilities , earnings power and proven strategic approach to wholesale markets , enron is the ideal strategic partner for dynegy , " dynegy chairman and chief executive officer chuck watson said in announcing the purchase . watson made it clear that he would not tolerate the sort of financial practices that prompted explosive disclosures by enron this week - including an admission that more than half a billion dollars in debt had been kept off the company ' s books . " as a combined company , we will focus on leveraging our core skill sets and , as always , we will keep a strong balance sheet and straightforward financial structure as key priorities , " watson said . enron is the country ' s top buyer and seller of natural gas , and the no . 1 wholesale power marketer . the company operates a 25 , 000 - mile gas pipeline system , and also markets and trades metals , paper , coal , chemicals , and fiber - optic bandwidth . dynegy controls nearly 15 , 000 megawatts of power generating capacity through investments in power projects , and sells the energy in wholesale markets and through utilities . at a news conference , watson said company officials who negotiated the deal came away convinced that enron was worth buying despite its recent troubles . " we looked under the hood and , guess what , it ' s just as strong as we thought it was , " watson said . under the terms of the deal , enron shareholders will receive . 2685 dynegy share for each share of enron common stock , valuing each enron share at $ 10 . 41 . enron has about 775 million common shares , said spokeswoman karen denne . that represents a 21 percent premium above enron ' s closing price of $ 8 . 63 friday on the new york stock exchange - but still just a fraction of their 52 - week high of $ 84 . 87 . dynegy ' s shares climbed $ 2 . 26 , or 6 percent , to close at $ 38 . 76 on the nyse . in after hours trading on the nyse , enron shares shot up 15 . 6 percent , or $ 1 . 35 , to $ 9 . 98 . dynegy shares were unchanged . dynegy ' s stockholders will own approximately 64 percent of the new company , with enron ' s stockholders holding the remainder . the boards of both companies have unanimously approved the transaction , which is expected to close next summer . the deal is expected to save the combined company between $ 400 and $ 500 million annually because of continued elimination of " non - core " enron holdings and lower operating costs . watson said it was too soon to say if the deal would result in job cuts . enron has about 20 , 000 employees , while dynegy ' s work force is about 6 , 000 . watson will remain as chairman and chief executive of the combined company , which will retain the dynegy inc . name . dynegy ' s steve bergstrom will continue as president . enron chairman and chief executive kenneth l . lay will no longer have a role in day - to - day management of the company , but has been offered a seat on the combined company ' s board and will help shepherd the merger through . dynegy said that greg whalley , the current president and chief operating officer of enron , will become an executive vice president of the new dynegy . he said the merger sets the best course for enron . " few of the options we considered for our core business going forward provided us with the earning potential and immediate synergies that a merger with dynegy could deliver , " whalley said . " together with enron ' s recently announced bank commitments , this cash infusion gives enron immediate liquidity , which we believe will enable the company to maintain its investment grade credit rating . " the merger was announced a day after enron acknowledged it overstated earnings by about 20 percent over the past four years and kept large amounts of debt off its balance sheets through business partnerships now under investigation by the securities and exchange commission . analysts said the merger rescues enron , but leaves dynegy in uncharted territory - with the outcome of the sec investigation completely unknown . " there is still a shroud hanging over enron that now moves over to dynegy , " said carol coale , an analyst with prudential securities . early friday , moody ' s investors service downgraded enron ' s debt ratings to one level above junk bond status and said the company ' s long - term debt ratings remain under review for further downgrade . in an sec filing , enron said financial statements from 1997 through the first half of 2001 " should not be relied upon " and that outside businesses run by enron officials during that period should have been included in the company ' s earnings reports . the revised statements reduced enron ' s profits for those years by $ 586 million , from $ 2 . 89 billion to $ 2 . 31 billion . the revisions also increased the company ' s debt each of the four years , reaching $ 10 . 86 billion - $ 628 million more than previously reported - by the end of 2000 . keeping the debt off its balance sheets likely ensured enron could maintain a strong credit rating to support expansion of its core businesses - wholesale trading of natural gas and electricity . but the company ' s stock price started dropping 10 months ago when its high - speed internet unit foundered and enron had trouble collecting money from power customers in india . the stock price began to free fall after enron announced a $ 618 million third quarter loss , and news of the sec investigation surfaced . enron responded by firing its chief financial officer and scrambled to get cash and increase credit lines in an attempt to regain investor confidence , but investors dumped enron shares and sent its stock plummeting . the ousted chief financial officer , andrew fastow , ran some of the partnerships under investigation by the sec . jeff skilling , enron ' s former chief executive who left in august , has been called to testify before the sec , although it ' s unclear when . - - - on the net : http : / / www . enron . com http : / / www . dynegy . com ap graphic dynegy enron copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved .

Subject: operations assignments welcome back , again . you will have to let me know when you have baby pictures in the office - would love to see them . last week , i orchestrated some changes within my operations organization which will free up more of my time to focus on the successful commercialization of mid and back office services . i have asked bob hall to lead operations for enron americas , with peggy hedstrom ( calgary operations ) , jeff gossett ( gas risk and south america operations ) , stacey white ( power risk ) and leslie reeves ( confirmations and settlements ) reporting directly to him . he is enthusiastic about the additional responsibility and i believe that he will do an excellent job for enron americas . other changes include appointing kevin sweeney as head of operations for eim , with brenda herod reassigned as part of a project team that will work on the ees assimilation . i have also asked beth apollo to play a project management lead role in the assimilation of ees into ews . i will be glad to fill you in on more details on any of these changes . the result is to give more responsibility to several key players - stretching them , but i will be there to support and coach them in their new roles if needed . plus , i can now devote significantly more time to the commercialization effort . in that regard , i did move to the 27 th floor ( next to piper ) while you were out on leave . i wanted to share these changes with you before a memo goes out across the organization next monday . call me if you would like to discuss . - - sally

Subject: re : efa meetings hey vince , thanks for your reply . i ' ll see what becomes of the session and keep you informed . as to the paper , tim crack and i have a revised version of the paper i gave you . we have since found out that by using certainty equivalence , our model is more robust . for example , if one has an asset pricing model that incorporates mean , variance , and skewness ( harvey and siddique , jf june , 2000 ) and a binomial model that incorporates mean , variance , and skewness ( johnson , paulukiewicz , and mehta , rqfa , 1997 ) , our model allows you to price options under the real world measure . the benefit is that one can take all of the model parameters from historical data that is non - risk neutralized . from a pricing perspective , there isn ' t a tremendous benefit in a mean - variance world ( variance stays the same in risk neutral or risky measure ) . however , in the mean - variance - skewness world , there is a benefit because we do not believe ( although we ' re still hunting down an appropriate cite ) skewness is the same under risk - neutral and risky measure . given we can only measure the skewness in our risky world , our model becomes much more significant . i would certainly appreciate comments on the version of the paper you have and would also pass on the new version of the paper if you would like to see it . thanks again , tom

Subject: status - " pcg wish list " i just wanted to give you an update on where we are on the pcg wish list . we discussed about a month ago the fact that we had close to 200 items on our list of development / enhancements to our applications . we met on numerous occasions with mark d . and team to prioritize , etc . however , i think primarily due to the reorg in it , and mark leaving the team , we have done a lot of talking over the past three weeks , but nothing has happened to date . jennifer and i met with hal elrod yesterday , and i have met with bob hillier a couple of times , and we seem to be on the right track now . i know bob hiller is looking for people in his group to support these needs . my concern is growing due to the fact that andrew parsons and team will be re - auditing us before the end of the year . the key control weakness of the pcg was the lack of profiles manger - i have stressed that this is # 1 on the list of things to do . i think we are fairly close , but we will need to start and complete testing over the next several weeks . my hope is that we push andrew back as far as possible ! please let me know if you have any questions - sheri

Subject: resume of mark giancola attached is the resume of mark giancola . mark is the husband of penny pan , a uva business school student for whom i was mentor last summer . penny has received a permanent offer and is inclined to accept if her husband can find suitable employment in houston . as you will see from his resume , mark has worked as an economist in the public and private sectors for the past 2 . 5 years . mark is interested in a role where he can use his abilities to analyze political , credit currency and related risks . please let me know if you have any interest . thanks , rich john : is there a place here in enroncredit . com ? _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ penny mentioned that you might have some ideas about job opportunities in houston for someone with my background . as you know , penny was pleased to receive an offer from enron and i plan to earnestly look into the houston job market myself . the weeks leading up to the annual imf / world bank meetings are one of the busiest times of year for us , but now that they are over i have had a chance to update my resume ( attached ) . i would be grateful if you would take a look and pass it on to anyone you think might be interested . as you will see , most of my background is policy related , and most recently international economic policy . however the skills i have developed have applicability in the private sector as well . for example , a large part of my job at the treasury involves sovereign risk analysis . two possible avenues i see for building on this knowledge are : 1 ) applying my knowledge to decisions regarding allocation of global financial assets ; or 2 ) identifying risks facing a mutinational company and developing strategies to reduce that risk . i should mention that in addition to my economics training i do understand basic finance , and i am preparing to begin the cfa . i should also note that the work environment here at the treasury is quite fast paced , with constant deadlines and a great deal of pressure placed on economists . i tend to work 55 + hours per week so i do not expect i would need to adjust signifiantly if i were to move to the private sector . i greatly appreciate your taking the time to look at my resume and giving some thought to where i might look . i welcome any comments and ideas you might have . thanks , mark giancola p . s . the formatting on my resume seems to change whenever i e - mail it ; let me know if you prefer that i fax it to you . - resume 8 . doc
Subject: edison mission energy this project , of all that have been proposed recently , probably has a better chance of success . first , mission energy is already a huge player in the ipp / cogen business in kern county , and is regarded as fairly skilled at getting permits / authorizations through the system . their existing facilites on texaco ' s leases currently produce over 1 , 000 mw of power . secondly , this project would sit smack dab in the middle of the midway - sunset field and is easily accessible off the west side lateral of kern / mojave ' s system . as such , they are probably a prime candidate for either phase i or phase ii of kern river ' s expansion . also , realize that texaco has a substantial amount of field area [ associated oil ] gas , so , depending on the structure of the texaco - mission energy sales agreement , mission probably has access to or call on this texaco production ( i . e . , they have the perfect physical hedge ) . kern would seem to be the " pipeline of choice " here . . . particularly , when you consider the impact of the reduced rates under their proposed expansion . without the direct connection into kern county , tw would have a difficult time competing . also , keep an eye out for el paso moving forward with commercial plans for the california leg of all american pipeline . a large end - use plant like this could be the basis for an " en - rate " type transport program on el paso - all american , particularly if they get their allocation problems resolved at ferc . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - forwarded by jeffery fawcett / et & s / enron on 11 / 22 / 2000 08 : 56 am - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - market intelligence - enron transportation services from : lorna brennan on 11 / 22 / 2000 08 : 48 am to : steven harris / et & s / enron @ enron , jeffery fawcett / et & s / enron @ enron , lorraine lindberg / et & s / enron @ enron , kevin hyatt / et & s / enron @ enron , christine stokes / et & s / enron @ enron , tk lohman / et & s / enron @ enron , michelle lokay / et & s / enron @ enron , lindy donoho / et & s / enron @ enron , lee huber / et & s / enron @ enron , susan scott / et & s / enron @ enron cc : subject : edison mission energy to build power plant in california edison mission energy , an edison international company , is purchasing the rights to the sunrise power project from texaco power and gasification . a proposed power generation facility to be located in kern county , calif . , the project will bring both short - and long - term generation capacity to the state , which is in dire need of new power generation . the sunrise power project will be completed in two phases . phase 1 will consist of a 320 - mw , simple - cycle peaking facility scheduled to be in service during the summer of 2001 . phase 2 will convert the peaking facility to a 560 - mw , combined - cycle operation with an in - service date of summer 2003 . final regulatory approvals should be received shortly for phase i of the project . edison mission energy plans to seek expedited permitting approval for the phase ii expansion in line with the fast - track approvals process recently enacted by the california legislature . edison mission energy specializes in the development , acquisition , construction management and operation of global power production facilities . the company owns nearly 23 , 000 mw of generating capacity , including interests in 75 projects currently under construction or operating in australia , indonesia , italy , new zealand , puerto rico , spain , thailand , turkey , the united kingdom and the united states .

line gc data is used as pipeline quality of gas in panhandle lateral because gs report from owens corning delivery point is quite similar to agave gc , 2 ) gas temperatures will become nearly the same as ground temperatures which is provided on scada at p - 1 and p 2 3 ) pressure and temperature profiles on the panhandle lateral at 6 / 14 , 9 : 00 am flowing conditions are listed below the following graph ( attached in ms word ) is a phase envelope using the agave red bluff gas analysis . by mapping the above relative pressure / temperature points it is clearly observed that pipeline pressure and temperature conditions approach and cross the hydrocarbon dewpoint line indicating that liquids would exist . the graph clearly shows that as the pressure and temperatures move further into the envelope the more liquids will be produced . that explains why more liquids are produced by pigging sections between cs p - 2 and cs p - 3 . furthermore , using the process model used to generate the phase envelope , the model indicates that gas at 800 psig and 65 degf would exist in both vapor and liquid phases . using a flow rate of 100 mmcfd the liquid phase fraction would be approximately 80 bbls . per day that could amount to approximately 2400 bbls . per month . this liquid volume compares closely to some of the recovery volumes reported by randy and walt below . lets get together on a conference call to further discuss findings and possible solutions . for a first stab , how about tuesday , 6 / 19 , at 8 : 00 am ( cst ) ? reply with availability and number of ports required . ef 713 / 853 -

3 ( which shuts us down , by the way ) , we would not have to use energas , we would not risk pushing condensate into a delivery point , and we would not incur the overtime when this happens . i ' m sure rich has some concerns also for the portion of the line in his region . we would like to run another pig as soon as possible to see what is left in the line and then ( depending on what we push into p - 3 ) get on a regular schedule . . . possibly once a month . what do you think we can do to work something out ? thanks for any help you can give us . 
Subject: re : trading support operations - london ted , we have had discussions about barry in the past and i have followed - up on specific instances you have mentioned - i believe they date back to 1998 and prior to my first hand experience of working with barry throughout 1999 , and the people who raised concerns then acknowledge that the environment has changed since then . we are not so barry - dependent . we have a team of quality risk management professionals as evidenced by the fact that it is the primary recruiting ground for the rac team ( david port , oliver gaylard ) . barry ' s role is much less hands - on now and he is not our candidate for the global products position - this will continue to be kevin sweeney . the role i suggest for barry is the high level co - ordination of the operations team - his energy , enthusiasm and ability to execute on a plan , combined with his considerable institutional knowledge , making a superior candidate difficult to find . frankly , i suggested steve young not for additional depth , but to address the relationship issue that clearly exists - i do not belittle this issue , and while i don ' t think that anyone can point to any " prosecutable " offences that barry may have committed in recent history , his management style doesn ' t help to promote the view that he is totally impartial and objective . i will say that he has always been open and frank ( very frank ) with me - indeed if mally and sweeney had been as open we may have had a different story to tell on helsinki . as an aside , i have not been involved in or consulted on the ' world tour ' , although i know that barry suggested this sort of thing to sally a few weeks back . i think it is great that brent price is involved , but we would be happy to contribute staff to this too . regards fernley to : fernley dyson / lon / ect @ ect cc : rick buy , sally beck / hou / ect @ ect subject : re : trading support operations - london fernley , as we discussed earlier this year , i have serious concerns about barry that i think are both well - founded and reasonably well documented . to be fair , i will say that since ql of last year , i have not seen any further " prosecutable " offenses and he has made some attempts at being more communicative . however , i am clearly unwilling to stake my career on his transformation , particulary with as influential person as john sherriff in charge of the office . probably more to the point , it continues to concern me that london has not developed an operations team that is not so barry - dependent . evidence to this effect are , the fact that he is your only candidate for the global products position , that someone from houston has to be part of the " world tour " in europe ( brent price ) , that your candidates for a senior interim operations head in helsinki was david port or richard sage , and that your suggestion for additional depth is steve young . further for the record , i believe that i am not the only one with whom barry has a credibility issue - arthur andersen , other global products personnell , and other risk people in london have expressed similar concerns to me - i just happen to be the most vocal . ted fernley dyson 02 / 08 / 2000 04 : 07 pm to : richard causey / corp / enron @ enron cc : rick buy / hou / ect @ ect , john sherriff / lon / ect @ ect , ted murphy / hou / ect @ ect , sally beck / hou / ect @ ect subject : trading support operations - london rick , not wishing to delay the comprehensive review of our trading support function , particularly as it relates to our global products business , we already have barry pearce taking a lead in this area . the issue of concern is whether this should be an interim measure or a more permanent solution . well - nothing is permanent in enron and i think barry understands this as well as anybody . if we had a more suitable candidate , we would give him / her the job . i have seen barry develop and mature over the last 12 months along with the team that we have built around him . i ' m convinced that he can add significant value by drawing the global products support functions ' in to the fold ' . however , he clearly has a credibility issue with ted in particular and , whilst i do not share ted ' s views , i do not hold barry out as a saint and i can see recurring problems if such a key relationship is not well grounded . i suggest that we continue to search for a candidate - known and trusted within houston , who can instill confidence there . steve young ( head of rac in london ) may be an interesting option , although i ' m sure he would not be easy to replace . in the meantime we need barry to take things forward and i will be monitoring the situation very closely . regards fernley .

[ 65 , 229 ] in both cases , the commission rejected rate design features where there was no evidence in the record showing that the rate design features reflected cost incurrence , id . in its order setting this proceeding for hearing , the commission took note of edison ' s proposed seasonal differential and specifically directed that the parties fully address the issues related to the cost support for the seasonal rate design , commission order issued march 30 , 1979 , mimeo at 4 - 5 . on october 9 , 1980 , the parties were directed by the presiding judge to identify in their initial briefs the portions of the record that relate to cost support for the seasonal differential . the requirement that edison provide cost support for its seasonal differential , as discussed supra , is also set forth in the commission ' s filing requirements for rate schedules : if the rate design is intended to reflect costs , the applicant must show how it reflects costs ; if the rate design is not intended to reflect costs , the applicant must justify the departure from costbased rates , 18 cfr o 35 . 13 ( b ) ( 4 ) ( iii ) statement p . edison ' s seasonal differential is intended to lessen the costs imposed upon it by its prominent summer peak . edison reasons that , since it must build capacity to meet its prominent summer peak , charging more in the summer would give customers an incentive to control their summer demands and , therefore , edison ' s cost of adding capacity would be reduced ( tr . 169 ) . accordingly , edison must show how its seasonal differential reflects the costs imposed on it by summer demand , under the commission ' s filing requirements in 18 cfr o 35 . 13 ( b ) ( 4 ) ( iii ) statement p . further , even purpa section 111 ( d ) ( 4 ) relied upon by edison states that rates " shall be on a seasonal basis which reflects the costs of providing service to such class of consumers at different seasons of the year to the extent that such costs vary seasonally for such utility . " ( emphasis added . ) further , support for relying on marginal rather than average costs comes from the commission itself . in its order of march 30 , 1979 setting this cause for hearing , mimeo at 4 , 5 , the commission , in commenting on time of day and seasonal rates , mentioned that it encourage innovative rate design to match more closely rates to costs . in this regard , the commission cited its order no . 537 , supra at 4 , which specifically suggests use of pricing mechanisms based on marginal cost principles [ 65 , 236 ] for jurisdictional wholesale sales . under the circumstances in this case , where the sale of economy energy is related to edison ' s costs in adding or eliminating additional excess capacity , it is appropriate to establish the price for economy transactions on marginal costs . this provides a more close matching of the rate to the cost than would a rate design based on average costs . accordingly , winnetka ' s position on pricing of economy energy will not be adopted . affirmed and reversed - see next paragraph comm - opinion - order , 23 ferc ? 61 , 219 , commonwealth edison company , docket nos . er 79 - 182 - 000 and er 80 - 106 - 000 , ( may 12 , 1983 ) turning to commonwealth ' s exceptions , we find that the judge correctly rejected the seasonal differential . even if we accept the company ' s interpretation of purpa , it still has not cited any record evidence whatsoever of a difference in costs between summer and nonsummer months . without at least some showing of a cost difference , it is impossible to make a judgment on the reasonableness of the company ' s 15 . 25 % proposal . we therefore uphold the judge on this point . we reverse the judge ' s adoption of a price set at 110 % of the utility ' s incremental costs , however , and approve the type - b split - savings method proposed by commonwealth . under this method , economy transactions are arranged for a 12 - hour or similar period at a fixed price based on cost estimates at the time of the agreement . if the utility ' s incremental costs rise to the point that continued supply would become burdensome , the utility may terminate supply . we find this method superior to that proposed by staff in that implementation is greatly simplified . cost determinations need not be made as frequently . related to pmas reg - preamble , fercsr ? 36 , 710 , procedures for public participation in power and transmission rate adjustments and extensions , december 31 , 1980 , 10 cfr 903 , 45 fr 86976 [ 36 , 741 ] historically , many purpa - type standards have been used in designing wholesale rates for the sale of federal hydroelectric power . pmas analyze costs to establish revenue requirements and consider this information in designing rates . declining block rates for energy were once used by the pmas but subsequently were found inappropriate and eliminated from rate schedules . many of the pmas for years have been effectively using various forms of load management measures in their rate schedules , such as scheduling limitations , loadshaping , capacity and energy overrun charges , etc . bpa has had a history of using seasonal rates for wholesale firm capacity and energy and also offered its direct service industrial customers interruptible rates some time ago . southwestern has had interruptible capacity rates in effect since 1957 . these examples demonstrate the willingness of the pmas to implement purpa - type standards where applicable . many of these purpa - type standards , when applied appropriately in the design of pma rates , can serve to implement the purposes of purpa by encouraging conservation of energy , efficient use of resources and facilities , and equitable rates . the public participation process will provide an opportunity to examine these and other appropriate concepts . the pmas will continue to review and revise their power marketing practices on a system - by - system basis to serve the purpa objectives . the assistant secretary for resource applications , working with the administrators of the power administrations , and after receiving public comment , will consider the adoption of rate design guidelines , similar in form to the guidelines in ra 6120 . 2 on financial accounting and ratemaking , which will reflect the experience gained by the pmas in their system - by - system approach to rate design . related to purpa fed - law , fercsr ? 5021 , purpa , sec . 111 . consideration and determination respecting certain ratemaking standards . ( 4 ) seasonal rates . - - the rates charged by an electric utility for providing electric service to each class of electric consumers shall be on a seasonal basis which reflects the costs of providing service to such class of consumers at different seasons of the year to the extent that such costs vary seasonally for such utility . fed - reg - notice , fercsr ? 37 , 503 , doe responsibilities under title i of purpa ( 4 ) seasonal rates shall be established where costs vary by season ; prop - reg - preamble , fercsr 1988 - 1998 ? 32 , 457 , administrative determination of full avoided costs , sales of power to qualifying facilities , and inter - connection facilities , march 16 , 1988 , docket no . rm 88 - 6 - 000 , 53 fr 9331 , 55 fr 31882 pricing flexibility may take several different forms . for instance , a contract could provide qfs with a price floor applicable to all the power supplied to the utility , but still provide for higher variable unit prices reflecting daily or seasonal periods . the price floor would provide the revenue stream necessary for the qf to secure financial support while [ 32 , 174 ] the price variability would induce the qf to maximize deliveries in peak - load periods when the utility values additional supplies most . of course , the price floor should not exceed the minimum value of the utility ' s avoided cost . similarly , a contract could provide for a two part price - - a fixed payment for capacity and an energy price for power delivered . the qf would be assured a minimum revenue stream based on the value of its capacity . the variable energy component would allow the utility to dispatch the qf capacity only when it was economic . whatever the pattern of contract payments , rates for purchases from qfs should always reflect how well the characteristics of the suppliers ' power match the purchasing utility ' s need . this will ensure that the qf will make most production decisions on the basis of rates reflecting avoided costs ( rather than the guaranteed average rate ) and , at the same time , will receive revenues sufficient to attract investors . to avoid problems such as those associated with take - or - pay contracts in the natural gas industry , the commission wishes to stress the danger of including forecasted fuel costs in the fixed rate structure of long - term contracts , especially in combination with the specification of minimum purchase quantities . the commission also encourages the use of time - of - day and seasonal rates in flexible pricing structures for long - term contracts . reg - preamble , fercsr 1977 - 1981 ? 30 , 128 , small power production and cogeneration facilities ; regulations implementing section 210 of the public utility regulatory policies act of 1978 , order no . 69 , february 25 , 1980 , docket no . rm 79 - 55 , 18 cfr 292 , 45 fr 12214 , 45 fr . . . rather than specifying that exact time - of - day or seasonal rates for purchases are required , however , the commission believes that the selection of a methodology is best left to the state regulatory authorities and nonregulated electric utilities charged with the implementation of these provisions .

Subject: ferc issues nopr on intra - day recalls of released capacity ngi ' s daily gas price index published : october 17 , 2001 ferc issues nopr on intra - day recalls of released capacity given the inability of the natural gas standards - setting organization to resolve the issue of intra - day recalls of released transportation capacity , ferc has issued a notice of proposed rulemaking ( nopr ) that would give releasing shippers the flexibility to re - nominate their recalled capacity at the next scheduling opportunity provided by an interstate pipeline . existing gas industry standards board ( gisb ) standards require a shipper that wants to re - nominate recalled capacity to notify its transportation provider by no later than 8 a . m . central clock time ( cct ) on a nomination day at the latest , and bars partial - day recalls of capacity . ferc proposes to allow shippers to recall capacity and re - nominate the recalled capacity at each of the three intra - day nomination opportunities . " by enabling releasing shippers to recall and renominate capacity quickly , they will have greater incentive to release capacity , providing capacity purchasers with an alternative to purchasing pipeline interruptible service . at the same time , this proposal will provide replacement shippers whose capacity is recalled with the same advance notice and protection from bumping as is provided to interruptible shippers under the commission ' s regulations , " the nopr said [ rm 96 - 1 - 019 ] . existing gisb standards applying to capacity - release recalls were adopted in 1996 , when there was only one nomination per day at 11 : 30 a . m cct and a single non - standardized intra - day nomination , it noted . " but the circumstances under which the recall standards were developed have markedly changed as the number of nomination opportunities have now expanded to four nomination opportunities . " given the lack of " consensus supporting " gisb ' s existing recall standards and the standards - setting group ' s failure to settle the issue , the commission is forced to " resolve the policy question regarding partial - day recalls , " the nopr said . permitting partial - day recalls of released capacity , the commission concluded , was in keeping with the overall regulatory changes that it enacted in order 637 . the natural gas supply association ( ngsa ) , which represents major producers , and houston - based dynegy let ferc know that they weren ' t big fans of partial - day recalls . these could undermine system reliability , they contend , by shutting in production and increasing scheduling problems , overruns , penalties or operational flow orders . but the commission discounted these arguments . " . . . [ t ] he use of partial - day recalls should create no additional scheduling problems since recalls will be scheduled according to the existing scheduling requirements . in effect , releasing shippers using partial - day recalls are creating another form of interruptible transportation to compete with pipeline interruptible capacity , and shippers purchasing recallable capacity should be subject to the same scheduling rules that apply to interruptible transportation . partial - day recalls will be no more likely to result in shut - in production than interruptible transactions that are subject to being bumped under the current standards , " the nopr noted .

Subject: calif governor declares state of emergency breaking news : ca governor declares state of emergency posted 2 : 37 am ( cst ) jan 18 , 2001 late wednesday following a day of rolling blackouts and the prospect for more with electricity supplies drying up throughout the west , california gov . gray davis declared a state of emergency due to the power shortage and directed the state water resources department to begin securing power supplies for the beleaguered state grid . in making the bold move , gov . davis also announced that his conservation plan for state facilities and operations already has reached its goal of reducing energy use by more than 5 % . in the emergency proclamation , the governor said that electricity presently available through california three major investor - owned utilities is " insufficient to prevent widespread and prolonged disruptions of electric service , " and thus , he was ordering all state agencies to use their resources to do whatever they can to alleviate the power shortage . then he went on to specifically empower the water resources agency , which has been a key player in helping the state ' s transmission grid operator ( cal - iso ) narrowly avoid blackouts or avoid them being felt more pervasively throughout the state . noting that peak electrical loads for state buildings and institutions are on target for a 200 mw reduction and the water resources department peak pumping load has been reduced by 450 mw , gov . davis lauded californians for having " stepped up to the plate and dramatically reduced their appetite for electricity , " noting that the state already is 47 th in the nation among the lowest per - capita energy use and the state ' s electricity prices are the 10 th highest in the nation .

Subject: dhabol jeff , we shall forward to you shortly a copy of the message from sandeep with the numbers you have requested . what follows below are the extracts from two recent articles on the power situation in india published by the financial times . the first article describes recent power outage in northern india affecting millions of people . one possible line of defense is pointing out to the value of output lost due to power shortages . it is obvious that the value of lost production exceeds the cost of power produced by the dhabol plant ( expensive as it may be ) . the power cut affected 230 million people . the second article is enron specific . vince asia - pacific : power failure hits north india financial times ; jan 3 , 2001 by angus donald tens of millions of people were left without electricity in northern india yesterday after a power grid breakdown . electricity was gradually switched on in some areas and most parts of the capital new delhi , with 60 to 70 per cent of supply expected to be restored by the end of the day , according to power grid officials . the associated chambers of commerce and industry ( assocham ) , a leading business organisation , expressed " deep concern " and called for a mechanism to prevent future disruption that could " cripple the economy " . the power failure across eight indian states , including new delhi , disrupted train services , water supplies and the telephone network and forced hospitals to switch to emergency generators . the fault occurred on the northern grid , which provides electricity for 226 m people , and affected the states of delhi , haryana , punjab , uttar pradesh , himachal pradesh , madhya pradesh , rajasthan and jammu and kashmir . a breakdown at a sub - station in kanpur in uttar pradesh , india ' s most populous state , caused an overload of power on other lines , which then failed as well . trains stopped running for most of the day and signals systems were damaged . new delhi international airport was also slightly affected before its own power supply could be engaged . " we will probe into the reasons for the failure . it is most likely to be a technical failure , but we will investigate why it happened , " suresh prabhu , the power minister , was quoted as saying by press trust of india . india suffers regularly from power problems because of lack of funding to upgrade infrastructure . theft of supplies is also a big problem . thirty per cent of the country ' s electricity is stolen , according to analysts . in new delhi as much as 50 per cent is stolen . two years ago , a power failure blacked out uttar pradesh and delhi for hours . assocham issued a statement , saying that increasing industrial demand would exacerbate the problems already faced by india ' s inefficient power sector . " the slow progress , particularly in strengthening the transmission and distribution system , and ever increasing theft will contribute to worsening the power supply situation further .

" ft " and " financial times " are trademarks of the financial times . privacy policy | terms jan 3 , 2001 by khozem merchant enron , the us energy producer and a constant target of criticism in india , is hitting back with a campaign to reverse its image as a profiteering multinational . its " myth and reality " offensive in local newspapers follows the west indian state of maharashtra ' s decision to review the tariff it pays the texas - based company , whose dollars 2 . 2 bn electricity generating plant at dabhol is india ' s biggest single foreign investment . maharashtra ' s tariff has more than doubled since 1993 and is three times greater than that charged by other independent power producers ( ipps ) . the tariff has risen because of the depreciation of the rupee against the dollar and the high but now falling price of naphtha fuel . the state also pays a fixed capacity charge of rs 970 m ( dollars 21 m ) a month , reflecting the huge project cost and , controversially , irrespective of consumption . a showdown looks inevitable , reminiscent of a clash six years ago that damaged india ' s appeal to foreign investors . a former official of the world bank , which has criticised the deal , says enron is emerging " as the east india company of the 21 st century " - a reference to the british trader that colonised key areas of the indian economy in the 19 th century . the stand - off is the latest blot on india ' s power sector . the uk ' s powergen and cogentrix of the us have quit india recently , frustrated by long approval procedures , inadequate payments mechanisms or because of higher returns elsewhere . " india has lost time and opportunity and has driven returns down by six percentage points , " says gerry grove - white , former india general manager of powergen , which has sold its 655 mw plant in gujarat to china light & power of hong kong . india ' s national plan for the five years to 2002 says generating capacity must rise by 40 , 000 mw to about 120 , 000 mw . but since 1992 , ipps have added only 3 , 000 mw and 2 , 500 mw remains under construction . this is insufficient to support official projections of 6 to 8 per cent economic growth . enron was a bellwether of india ' s liberalisation , winning fast - track project approval in the early 1990 s . phase 1 , a 740 mw plant fuelled by expensive naphtha came on stream in may 1999 , and phase 2 , a dollars 1 . 87 bn plant of 1 , 624 mw capacity that will run on cheaper liquefied natural gas ( lng ) , will be completed this year . only two of seven other fast - track proposals have achieved financial closure . from the outset enron encountered attacks , culminating in maharashtra ' s then nationalist government cancelling the project before renegotiating terms no less onerous . vilasrao deshmukh , chief minister of the successor government , says the power purchase agreement is unaffordable . enron , whose attackers also include cultural chauvinists , wants to maintain good political relations in a hostile but lucrative environment . enron views india as a testing ground for its evolution from a traditional manager of power plants to a broad - based trader of commodities , such as energy , gas and bandwidth . to support these ambitions enron hopes to trade energy between power surplus and deficit states , once legislation is passed this year . it is building an lng terminal and pipelines to trade imported natural gas . and it is laying a 15 , 000 km fibre - optic network to trade bandwidth space in a country desperately short of this new economy commodity . in any event , enron believes it has a watertight contract . it is supported by many that believe any subversion of the contract would confirm investor perception of maharashtra , india ' s financial and industrial hub , as an unreliable destination for investment . mr deshmukh - who has avoided the language of his predecessor , which threatened to " dump dabhol into the arabian sea " - is under pressure from radical members of his wobbly coalition . but his options are limited . scrapping the project would be ruinous for an economically troubled state that would have to compensate shareholders . maharashtra state electricity board , the local utility and enron ' s main client , is obliged to dispatch or " off - take " 90 per cent of dabhol ' s output . yet mseb has never honoured these guarantees . its off - take has averaged 60 per cent since the plant opened and , in effect , mseb has been paying a lot more while consuming a lot less power . one reason off - take is low is because the state ' s tough new regulator has told mseb to buy from cheaper sources . enron says the tariff would be rs 4 . 02 / kwh if mseb ' s off - take averaged 90 per cent . but with off - take a third lower , the average tariff is rs 4 . 94 per unit , and often higher . in october , the tariff was rs 6 . 91 per unit , when off - take was about 49 per cent . enron says tariffs should come down when phase 2 , run on cheaper lng , starts . these cost pressures have forced mseb to take up only half of a 30 per cent equity option in phase 2 . enron has acquired the balance and mandated bankers to find a buyer . enron ' s difficulties have undermined the appeal of ipps , which have failed to deliver the flood of investments . potential ipps feared they would never be paid by state generating boards that have become a byword for corrupt management of power . reform of state electricity boards , whose uneconomic pricing means industrial users subsidise poor farmers , as well as transmission and distribution ( t & d ) services to check huge theft and technical losses , is overdue . " given the limited resources , money would be better spent on t & d rather than on new plant , " says oliver blackaby , managing director of n m rothschild in india , which is advising karnataka on the privatisation of its distribution network . for the moment , attention is fixed on enron ' s ability to satisfy the competing interests of investors and clients . as sanjay bhatnagar , chief executive officer of enron india , said in a recent trade magazine , one of the key lessons learned from phase 2 is " having flexibility to deal with externalities " . copyright : the financial times limited , copyright the financial times limited 2000 .

Subject: dpr signoff the risk management policy requires signoff on the dpr by individuals designated by the coo and cro of enron corp . currently , greg is the sole authorized signer . given that he is moving into cyberspace it has been proposed that we split the world in half with john l taking the western hemisphere and john s taking the rest of the world . i am currently drafting a memo for jeff and rick ' s signature to that effect , in the meantime , i would expect that greg remain the official signer . i will forward that draft memo to you for commentary under separate cover . once we have agreed on who as responsibility for what , we will ask that the johns reply to an e - mail request for approval . eventually , we will create an automatic approval via the executive reports viewer . before finalizing process , there are some issues that ought to be clarified , such as , who will signoff for the merchant portfolios that are not part of either johns direct responsibility ( southern cone , calme ) , broadband , the capital portfolio . for pure process reasons , we would like to keep the number of signers ot a minimum . it is difficult enough to get greg to sign off in a timely manner , it would be too cumbersome for mike moscoso or chris abel to chase down someone from every business unit every day for approvals . please let me know if you have any suggestions or changes to this proposal . ted x 3 - 3324 ps . liz , make sure greg pays attention to this e - mail !

Subject: thanks for taking time this morning to go over some goals for enrononline . as far as i ' m concerned , the platform we have is astonishing , and i agree that the more we lengthen our lead over the competition ( in both trading and technology ) the better our chances of landing some private marketplace sales . to that end , jay and i will begin hounding the trading heads and rounding up development needs and potential enhancements to boost trade volume and revenue . also , we ' ll get kal focused on periodic face - lifts of the gui . then we will devote origination attention to third party sales which will validate our contention that the platform has value outside of its considerable worth to enron . if resources become constrained , it will simply mean that we are finding traction in the right places . yes , i am excited about this job , and yes , i want to be in the hot seat you and greg are describing . i hope i can run ideas past you from time to time and i trust you will let me know when you have comments or concerns . thanks , brad
